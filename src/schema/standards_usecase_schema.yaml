  Data schema for Bridge2AI Standards Use Cases.
enums:
  UseCaseCategory:
    description: >-
      Category of use case. These define the high-level
      purpose of a task or activity as part of a broader
      research effort or other data-related project.
      They are not mutually exclusive and one use case
      may involve multiple categories.
    permissible_values:
      acquisition:
        description: >-
          Acquisition. The use case involves the collection of data
          from one or more sources, including data
          generation, data capture, and data entry.
      application:
        description: >-
          Application. The use case involves the use of data for
          a specific scientific or otherwise productive purpose,
          including data analysis, data visualization, and data
          interpretation. This also includes clinical decision
          support, patient care, and other applications of data
          in a biomedical context.
      assessment:
        description: >-
          Assessment. The use case involves the evaluation of data
          quality, data provenance, and data utility, including
          the assessment of standards, data tools, and data
          resources. Note this differs from the standardization
          category, which involves the application of standards
          to data.
      integration:
        description: >-
          Integration. The use case involves the combination of data
          from multiple sources, including data harmonization,
          data linkage, and data aggregation.
      modeling:
        description: >-
          Modeling. The use case involves the development of
          models, including predictive models, statistical
          models, and machine learning models.
      standardization:
        description: >-
          Standardization. The use case involves the application of
          standards to data, including data normalization,
          data validation, and quality control.

      List of identifiers of standards and tools;
      those not explicitly planned to be used,
      by one or more Bridge2AI DGPs in addressing this use case
      but serving as viable alternatives,
      from those in the Standards Registry.

  involved_in_experimental_design:
    description: >-
      True if use case is likely to be implemented as
      part of an experimental procedure or collection
      of data to be used as part of an experiment.
    is_a: node_property
    range: boolean
  involved_in_metadata_management:
    description: >-
      True if use case is likely to be implemented as
      part of metadata indexing, sample tracking,
      or any other storage of high-level data properties.
      Includes use cases in which metadata will be
      collected along with data.
    is_a: node_property
    range: boolean
  involved_in_quality_control:
    description: >-
      A value of True indicates a use case is likely to be
      implemented as part of data validation operations.

    range: boolean
  known_limitations:
    description: >-
      Any current obstacles to implementing this use case.
      This could be a selection from one or more predefined categories
      including lack of standards, lack of relevant patient cohort,
      lack of funding, etc.
