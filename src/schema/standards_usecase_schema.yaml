  use_case_category:
    is_a: node_property
    range: UseCaseCategory
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      Category of the UseCase.
      Not all projects will incorporate use cases in all categories.
      This is multivalued, as a use case may span categories.
  known_limitations:
    is_a: node_property
    range: string
    description: >-
      Any current obstacles to implementing this use case.
      This could be a selection from one or more predefined categories
      including lack of standards, lack of relevant patient cohort,
      lack of funding, etc.
  relevance_to_dgps:
    range: DataGeneratingProject
    description: Relevance of the use case to one or more DGPs.
    multivalued: true
  data_topics:
    is_a: node_property
    range: DataTopic
    description: Relevance of the use case to one or more data topics.
    multivalued: true
  data_substrates:
    is_a: node_property
    range: DataSubstrate
    description: Relevance of the use case to one or more data substrates.
    multivalued: true
  standards_and_tools_for_dgp_use:
    is_a: node_property
    range: DataStandardOrTool
    description: >-
      List of identifiers of standards and tools;
      those planned to be used, or already in use,
      by one or more Bridge2AI DGPs in addressing this use case,
      from those in the Standards Registry.
      If no value is provided here, the use case may not have
      a direct relationship to a standard or tool.
    multivalued: true
  alternative_standards_and_tools:
    is_a: node_property
    range: DataStandardOrTool
    description: >-
      List of identifiers of standards and tools;
      those not explicitly planned to be used,
      by one or more Bridge2AI DGPs in addressing this use case
      but serving as viable alternatives,
      from those in the Standards Registry.
    multivalued: true
  enables:  # Should probably be an association type
    is_a: node_property
    range: UseCase
    description: >-
      List of other use case(s) this use case supports
      or makes possible.
    multivalued: true
  involved_in_experimental_design:
    is_a: node_property
    range: boolean
    description: >-
      True if use case is likely to be implemented as
      part of an experimental procedure or collection
      of data to be used as part of an experiment.
  involved_in_metadata_management:
    is_a: node_property
    range: boolean
    description: >-
      True if use case is likely to be implemented as
      part of metadata indexing, sample tracking,
      or any other storage of high-level data properties.
      Includes use cases in which metadata will be
      collected along with data.
  involved_in_quality_control:
    is_a: node_property
    range: boolean
    description: >-
      A value of True indicates a use case is likely to be
      implemented as part of data validation operations.
  use_cases:
    description: Collection of associated use cases.
    range: UseCase
    inlined: true
    inlined_as_list: true
    multivalued: true

enums:
  UseCaseCategory:
    description: >-
      Category of use case. These define the high-level
      purpose of a task or activity as part of a broader
      research effort or other data-related project.
      They are not mutually exclusive and one use case
      may involve multiple categories.
    permissible_values:
      acquisition:
        description: >-
          Acquisition. The use case involves the collection of data
          from one or more sources, including data
          generation, data capture, and data entry.
      integration:
        description: >-
          Integration. The use case involves the combination of data
          from multiple sources, including data harmonization,
          data linkage, and data aggregation.
      standardization:
        description: >-
          Standardization. The use case involves the application of
          standards to data, including data normalization,
          data validation, and quality control.
      modeling:
        description: >-
          Modeling. The use case involves the development of
          models, including predictive models, statistical
          models, and machine learning models.
      application:
        description: >-
          Application. The use case involves the use of data for
          a specific scientific or otherwise productive purpose,
          including data analysis, data visualization, and data
          interpretation. This also includes clinical decision
          support, patient care, and other applications of data
          in a biomedical context.
      assessment:
        description: >-
          Assessment. The use case involves the evaluation of data
          quality, data provenance, and data utility, including
          the assessment of standards, data tools, and data
          resources. Note this differs from the standardization
          category, which involves the application of standards
          to data.
