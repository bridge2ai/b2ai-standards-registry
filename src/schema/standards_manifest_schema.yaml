  Manifest:
    is_a: NamedThing
    description: >-
      Represents a manifest.
      There should be a 1 to 1 mapping between
      a manifest and an organization,
      but each manifest has its own ID.
    slots:
      - organization
      - datasets
      - data_parts
      - notes

  ManifestContainer:
    description: >-
      A container for Manifests.
    slots:
      - manifest_collection

  DataPart:
    description: >-
      Represents a part of all datasets in a manifest.
      This may be a file, table, or other component.
      It does not have to be associated with a single dataset,
      but represents a general type of data produced
      by the organization.
