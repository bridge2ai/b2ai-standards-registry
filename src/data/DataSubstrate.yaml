    description:
      Oxygen saturation is a physiological signal that measures
      the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated
      with oxygen. It is used in biomedicine and biology to assess
      respiratory function and oxygen delivery to tissues.

      Caloric burn data is a type of physical activity data that
      measures the number of calories burned during physical activity.
      It is used in biomedicine and biology to assess energy expenditure
      and the effects of physical activity on metabolism and other
      physical characteristics.
