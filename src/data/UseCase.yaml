    name: Obtain patient data from records of clinical visits.
    category: UseCase
    use_case_category: acquisition
    description: Collecting clinical data from patient visits involves the process of gathering information about a patient's medical history, current symptoms, and other relevant information during a healthcare appointment. This typically includes taking a detailed medical history, conducting a physical examination, ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests, and documenting the findings in the patient's medical record. This may also include more focused evaluations, as with the AI-READI projectâ€™s assessments of cognitive function and visual acuity. Medical records may include structured/unstructured text, values for lab results, and/or images.

    category: UseCase
    use_case_category: acquisition
    description: Clinical waveform data from an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a representation of the electrical activity of the heart. The EKG measures the voltage between different points on the body and records the resulting waveform. This waveform can be used to diagnose a variety of heart conditions, including arrhythmias and heart attacks. It is typically recorded using a machine that is attached to the patient via electrodes.

    category: UseCase
    use_case_category: acquisition
    description: Patient data from laboratory analysis typically includes results from tests that have been performed on samples taken from the patient, such as blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. Serological testing is a type of laboratory analysis that involves testing blood serum (the liquid part of blood) for the presence of various indicators of disease or health. Urinalysis is another common type of laboratory analysis that involves testing urine samples for various factors, such as the presence of bacteria, glucose, or other substances. Test results may or may not be derived from EHR data. Here, data includes records from mobile devices used to complement laboratory diagnostics, including continuous glucose monitoring.

This data can include things like steps taken, heart rate, sleep patterns, and other metrics that can be used to track health and fitness. Activity data may be viewed in aggregate (e.g., number of steps per day above a threshold rather than exact counts or geolocation data) to serve as approximates of physical fitness assessments otherwise performed by clinical personnel.

These conditions are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. SDoH are largely responsible for health inequities - unfair and avoidable differences in health status from person to person. SDoH data may be collected directly from individuals or based on integration with other data, but it generally includes at least one of the following factors poverty and income inequality, education and literacy, employment and working conditions, gender and gender equality, social exclusion and discrimination, housing and living conditions, or access to healthcare."

(2021) Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04115-9), imaging data and biophysical association data may be combined to develop measurements of protein distance within subcellular systems. This use case builds on that strategy by adding a third component: measurement of transcript changes under perturbation conditions for each protein. For the CM4AI DGP, this process involves evidence graphs. The result here is not a full subcellular map, but rather the integrated data necessary to assemble such a map."

This may include removing duplicate records, filling in missing data, and standardizing field names and values. The data is then validated to ensure that it is accurate and complete. Standardized data is then integrated into a central repository.

    category: UseCase
    use_case_category: standardization
    description: As with other clinical observations and records, standardizing waveform data is largely a process of collection, cleaning, transformation, validation, and storage. The features of waveforms, whether audio or cardiac in origin, require specific handling to ensure physiologically-relevant details are retained. Raw waveform data is quite large and therefore consumes more disk space than most database architectures are prepared to operate with. This data may be collected continuously, leading to accumulation of large quantities of incoming observations to store and analyze. standardization must therefore be sensitive to the size and resolution of waveform data.

It also includes image metadata properties such as consistent labeling and format. Depending on subsequent applications, it may require image processing, such as normalization, to correct for variations in appearance due to differences in equipment or patient positioning.

    description: As per Qin et al. (2021) Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04115-9), imaging data and biophysical association data may be combined to develop measurements of protein distance within subcellular systems. When combined with other data (see B2AI_USECASE:16) the result is a map of cell architecture. Some degree of standardization will be necessary among these maps, such that they may be combined while retaining consistent biologically-relevant observations.

    description: Computational provenance is a record of the processes and data used to produce a computational result. Constructing standards for computational provenance involves establishing protocols for how this information should be recorded, stored, and shared. This can include what information provenance records must contain, their format(s), and any connections to the resulting computation. Additionally, standards may be established for how provenance should be validated and authenticated to ensure its accuracy and trustworthiness.

    description: Developing models of clinical image data may involve annotation, preprocessing, and model training. Generally, annotation requires labeling  images with disease or clinical phenotype-relevant information such as labels, bounding boxes, and segmentation masks. The annotation process may be assisted by automated methods, particularly in cases where patient features are already known. Preprocessing such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation then prepares the labeled images for model training. The training process applies machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from the data and make predictions on new images.

The exact amount of time between events may not be as important as their order and may therefore be abstracted.

    description: As presented by the Voice DGP, a set of patient voice recordings may be analyzed in an automated manner through the machine learning approach of federated learning. In federated learning, a central model is first trained on a dataset distributed among many devices or clients. Individual clients train their own copies of the model on their own data, then send updated model parameters to the central server. The server then averages newly updated parameters from all clients to produce a new global model. It returns the new model to the clients and the process repeats.

There may be a need for converting the model to a format that can be used in a specific runtime environment or monitoring the model's performance in a production environment and making adjustments as needed. Deploying the analytical model may require consideration of validation, regulatory approval, ethics, and compliance with patient privacy laws.
