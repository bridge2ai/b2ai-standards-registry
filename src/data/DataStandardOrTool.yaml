  is_open: true
  name: .ACE format
  purpose_detail: The ACE file format is a specification for storing data about genomic
    contigs. The original ACE format was developed for use with Consed, a program
    for viewing, editing, and finishing DNA sequence assemblies. ACE files are generated
    by various assembly programs, including Phrap, CAP3, Newbler, Arachne, AMOS (sequence
    assembly) (more specifically Minimo) and Tigr Assembler v2.

  purpose_detail: NIH has issued the Data Management and Sharing (DMS) policy (effective
    January 25, 2023) to promote the sharing of scientific data. Sharing scientific
    data accelerates biomedical research discovery, in part, by enabling validation
    of research results, providing accessibility to high-value datasets, and promoting
    data reuse for future research studies. Under the DMS policy, NIH expects that
    investigators and institutions do the following. Plan and budget for the managing
    and sharing of data, Submit a DMS plan for review when applying for funding, Comply
    with the approved DMS plan.

  description: Access to Biological Collections Data Schema
  has_relevant_organization:
  - B2AI_ORG:93
  is_open: true
  name: ABCD
  purpose_detail: The Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD) Schema is an evolving
    comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens
    and observations (a.k.a. primary biodiversity data). The ABCD Schema attempts
    to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide variety
    of databases. It is compatible with several existing data standards. Parallel
    structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated.
    Version 1.2 is currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information
    Facility) and BioCASE (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe) networks.
    Apart from the GBIF and BioCASE networks, the potential for the application of
    ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets
    from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's
    own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible). By defining relations
    between terms, ABCD is a step towards an ontology for biological collections.

    smaller objects. The large object can be a contig, a scaffold (supercontig), or
    a chromosome. Each line (row) of the AGP file describes a different piece of the
    object, and has the column entries defined below. Extended comments follow. It
    does not serve for either a description of how sequence reads were assembled,
    or a description of the alignments between components used to construct a larger
    object. Not all of the information in proprietary assembly files can be represented
    in the AGP format. It is also not for recording the spans of features like repeats
    or genes.

  name: AnIML
  purpose_detail: The Analytical Information Markup Language (AnIML) is the emerging
    ASTM XML standard for analytical chemistry data. It is currently in pre-release
    form. It is a combination of a highly flexible core schema that defines XML tagging
    for any kind of analytical information; A set of technique definition documents.
    These XML files, one per analytical technique, apply tight constraints to the
    flexible core and in turn are defined by the Technique Schema; Extensions to Technique
    Definitions are possible to accommodate vendor- and institution-specific data
    fields. Mission Statement Our goal is to serve as the open-source development
    platform for a new XML standard for Analytical Chemistry Information. The project
    is a collaborative effort between many groups and individuals and is sanctioned
    by the ASTM subcommittee E13.15. http://animl.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/animl/schema/animl-core.xsd

  purpose_detail: The Annotation and Image Markup project provides a standardized
    schema for capturing the results of medical imaging exams, primarily radiology,
    using controlled terminologies/ontologies. AIM captures results in terms of the
    region within an image in which areas of interest are located, the semantic descriptions
    of those regions, inferences about them, calculations on them, and quantitative
    features derived by computer programs run on them. AIM is interoperable with DICOM-SR
    and HL7-CDA, other standards for image metadata, but it provides unique advantages
    by providing an explicit semantic model of imaging results.

  purpose_detail: The curation process is significantly slowed down by missing information
    in the articles analyzed. The identity of the clones used to generate ISH probes
    and the precise sequences tested in reporter assays constituted the most frequent
    omissions. To help authors ensure in the future that necessary information is
    present in their article, the Article Minimum Information Standard (AMIS) guidelines
    have been defined. The guideline describes the mandatory (and useful) information
    that should be mentioned in literature articles to facilitate the curation process.
    These guidelines extend the minimal information defined by the MISFISHIE format
    (Deutsch at al. 2008, Nature Biotechnology).

  purpose_detail: BioPAX is a standard language that aims to enable integration, exchange,
    visualization and analysis of biological pathway data. Specifically, BioPAX supports
    data exchange between pathway data groups and thus reduces the complexity of interchange
    between data formats by providing an accepted standard format for pathway data.
    By offering a standard, with well-defined semantics for pathway representation,
    BioPAX allows pathway databases and software to interact more efficiently. In
    addition, BioPAX enables the development of pathway visualization from databases
    and facilitates analysis of experimentally generated data through combination
    with prior knowledge. The BioPAX effort is coordinated closely with that of other
    pathway related standards initiatives namely; PSI-MI, SBML, CellML, and SBGN in
    order to deliver a compatible standard in the areas where they overlap.

  has_relevant_organization:

  is_open: true
  name: BRISQ
  publication: doi:10.1002/cncy.20147
  purpose_detail: Human biospecimens are subject to a number of different collection,
    processing, and storage factors that can significantly alter their molecular composition
    and consistency. These biospecimen preanalytical factors, in turn, influence experimental
    outcomes and the ability to reproduce scientific results. Currently, the extent
    and type of information specific to the biospecimen preanalytical conditions reported
    in scientific publications and regulatory submissions varies widely. To improve
    the quality of research utilizing human tissues, it is critical that information
    regarding the handling of biospecimens be reported in a thorough, accurate, and
    standardized manner. The Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality (BRISQ)
    recommendations outlined herein are intended to apply to any study in which human
    biospecimens are used. The purpose of reporting these details is to supply others,
    from researchers to regulators, with more consistent and standardized information
    to better evaluate, interpret, compare, and reproduce the experimental results.
    The BRISQ guidelines are proposed as an important and timely resource tool to
    strengthen communication and publications around biospecimen-related research
    and help reassure patient contributors and the advocacy community that the contributions
    are valued and respected

  is_open: true
  name: Define
  purpose_detail: The CDISC Case Report Tabulation Data Definition Specification (define.xml)
    Version 1.0 reflects changes from a comment period through the Health Level 7
    (HL7) Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Technical Committee (RCRIM)
    in December 2003 (www.hl7.org) and CDISC's website in September 2004 as well as
    the work done by the define.xml team in conjunction with the CDISC ODM team to
    add functionality, features, and additional documentation. This document specifies
    the standard for providing Case Report Tabulations Data Definitions in an XML
    format for submission to regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA). The XML schema used
    to define the expected structure for these XML files is based on an extension
    to the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM). The 1999 FDA electronic submission
    (eSub) guidance and the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) documents
    specify that a document describing the content and structure of the included data
    should be provided within a submission. This document is known as the Data Definition
    Document (e.g., define.pdf in the 1999 guidance). The Data Definition Document
    provides a list of the datasets included in the submission along with a detailed
    description of the contents of each dataset. To increase the level of automation
    and improve the efficiency of the Regulatory Review process, define.xml can be
    used to provide the Data Definition Document in a machine-readable format.

    most of the central concepts in chemistry. It was the first language to be developed
    and plays the same role for chemistry as MathML for mathematics and GML for geographical
    systems. CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules, reactions,
    solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a special flexible approach
    to numeric science it also covers a very wide range of chemical properties, parameters
    and experimental observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication
    between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been heavily informed
    by the current chemical scholarly literature and chemical databases. XML is a
    mainstream approach providing semantics for science, such as MathML, SBML/BIOPAX
    (biology), GML and KML (geo) SVG (graphics) and NLM-DTD, ODT and OOXML (documents).
    CML provides support for most chemistry, especially molecules, compounds, reactions,
    spectra, crystals and computational chemistry (compchem). CML has been developed
    by Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa since 1995. It is the de facto XML for chemistry,
    accepted by publishers and with more than 1 million lines of Open Source code
    supporting it. CML can be validated and built into authoring tools (for example
    the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Word). A list of CML-compliant and CML-aware
    software can be found on the software page. The infrastructure includes legacy
    converters, dictionaries and conventions, Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. There
    are several versions of the CML schema. The most recent schema is schema 3. This
    essentially relaxes many of the constraints imposed in the previous stable release
    (schema 2.4), allowing users to put together the elements and attributes in a
    more flexible manner to fit the data that they want to represent more easily.

  description: Description Language for Taxonomy
  is_open: true
  name: DELTA
  purpose_detail: When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs,
    the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a particular
    program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data that can be represented,
    and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with
    a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions
    of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters
    to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially
    in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured
    by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system
    was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use
    by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile
    enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data.
    Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if
    computer processing of the data is not envisaged.

  purpose_detail: PS3.14 specifies a standardized Display Function for display of
    grayscale images. It provides examples of methods for measuring the Characteristic
    Curve of a particular Display System for the purpose of either altering the Display
    System to match the Grayscale Standard Display Function, or for measuring the
    conformance of a Display System to the Grayscale Standard Display Function. Display
    Systems include such things as monitors with their associated driving electronics
    and printers producing films that are placed on light-boxes or alternators.

  purpose_detail: This Part of the DICOM Standard defines an interface between two
    software applications. One application, the Hosting System, provides the second
    application with data, such as a set of images and related data. The second application,
    the Hosted Application, analyzes that data, potentially returning the results
    of that analysis, for example in the form of another set of images and/or structured
    reports, to the first application. Such an Application Program Interface (API)
    differs in scope from other portions of the DICOM Standard in that it standardizes
    the data interchange between software components on the same system, instead of
    data interchange between different systems.

    and attached to taxonomic data sets. It resulted from discussions at the International
    Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for Plant Sciences (TDWG) between 1989 and
    1992. Users and potential users of the standard include economic botanists and
    ethnobotanists whose purpose is to record all known information about the uses
    of a taxon; educationalists, taxonomists, biochemists, anatomists etc. who wish
    to record plant use, often at a broad level; economic botany collection curators
    who need to describe accurately the uses and values of specimens in their collections;
    bibliographers who need to describe plant uses referred to in publications and
    to apply keywords consistently for ease of data retrieval. While this standard
    is still in use, it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the
    TDWG website).

  is_open: true
  name: EDF
  purpose_detail: A simple digital format supporting the technical aspects of exchange
    and storage of polygraphic signals has been specified. Implementation of the format
    is simple and independent of hard- or software environments. It allows for any
    local montages, transducers, prefiltering, sampling frequencies, etc. At present,
    7 laboratories in various countries have used the format for exchanging sleep-wake
    recordings. These exchanges have made it possible to create a common database
    of sleep records, to compare the analysis algorithms local to the various laboratories
    to each other by applying these algorithms to identical signals, and to set up
    a computer-aided interlaboratory evaluation of manual and automatic analysis methods.

    format for data files was adopted as FCS 1.0. This standard was modified in 1990
    as FCS 2.0 and again in 1997 as FCS 3.0. We report here on the next generation
    Flow Cytometry Standard data file format. FCS 3.1 is a minor revision based on
    suggested improvements from the community. The unchanged goal of the Standard
    is to provide a uniform file format that allows files created by one type of acquisition
    hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type.

  purpose_detail: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) is
    a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure four domains of HRQOL in cancer patients
    - Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. Original development
    and validation involved 854 patients with cancer and 15 oncology specialists.
    An initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer
    was generated by open-ended interviews with patients experienced with the symptoms
    of cancer and oncology professionals. Using preselected criteria, items were reduced
    to a 38-item general version. Factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on
    545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 27-item FACT-General
    (FACT-G). Coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. The scale's
    ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance
    status rating (PSR), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity. It has
    also demonstrated sensitivity to change over time.

  description: Functional Genomics Experiment Markup Language
  is_open: true
  name: FuGE-ML
  purpose_detail: Functional genomics experiments present many challenges in data
    archiving, sharing and querying. As the size and complexity of data generated
    from such experiments grows, so does the requirement for standard data formats.
    To address these needs, the Functional Genomics Experiment [Object Model / Markup-Language]
    (FuGE-OM, FuGE-ML) has been created to facilitate the development of data standards.FuGE
    is a model of the shared components in different functional genomics domains.
    FuGE facilitates the development of data standards in functional genomics in two
    ways. 1. FuGE provides a model of common components in functional genomics investigations,
    such as materials, data, protocols, equipment and software. These models can be
    extended to develop modular data formats with consistent structure. 2. FuGE provides
    a framework for capturing complete laboratory workflows, enabling the integration
    of pre-existing data formats. In this context, FuGE allows the capture of additional
    metadata that gives formats a context within the complete workflow. FuGE is available
    as a UML model and an XML Schema

  description: Gating-ML specification
  is_open: true
  name: Gating-ML
  purpose_detail: The Gating-ML specification represents a proposal on how to form
    unambiguous XML-based gate definitions that may be used independently as well
    as included as one of the components of ACS. Such a description of gates can facilitate
    the interchange and validation of data between different software packages with
    the potential of significant increase of hardware and software interoperability.
    The specification supports rectangular gates in n dimensions (i.e., from one-dimensional
    range gates up to n-dimensional hyper-rectangular regions), polygon gates in two
    (and more) dimensions, ellipsoid gates in n dimensions, decision tree structures,
    and Boolean collections of any of the types of gates. Gates can be uniquely identified
    and may be ordered into a hierarchical structure to describe a gating strategy.
    Gates may be applied on parameters as in list mode data files (e.g., FCS files)
    or on transformed parameters as described by any explicit parameter transformation.
    Therefore, since version 1.5, parameter transformation and compensation description
    are included as part of the Gating-ML specification.

  description: Gene Product Annotation Data format
  is_open: true
  name: GPAD
  purpose_detail: The Gene Ontology project provides annotations describing attributes
    of biological entities such as genes and gene products. The Gene Ontology has
    historically provided annotations via Gene Association Format (GAF), including
    GAF-1 and GAF-2. Ontologies are distributed separately, using an OWL serialization
    or OBO format. The use of GAF has some drawbacks. Combined representation of gene/gene
    product data and annotations leads to redundancy/repetition No way to represent
    gene/gene product metadata for unannotated genes Requirement to maintain backward
    compatibility makes it harder to introduce enhancements such as use of an ontology
    for evidence types GAF formats will continue to be supported, but the need for
    a way to represent genes/gene products separately from annotations, as well as
    the need to use the evidence ontology has lead to the creation of the GPAD (Gene
    Product Annotation Data) and GPI (Gene Product Information) formats, defined here.
    Whilst GPAD and GPI have been defined for use within the Gene Ontology Consortium
    for GO annotation, this specification is designed to be reusable for analagous
    ontology-based annotation - for example, gene phenotype annotation.

  is_open: true
  name: GlycoCT
  publication: doi:10.1016/j.carres.2008.03.011
  purpose_detail: GlycoCT format is devised to describe the carbohydrate sequences,
    with a controlled vocabulary to name monosaccharides, adopting IUPAC rules to
    generate a consistent, machine-readable nomenclature, based on a connection table
    approach, instead of a linear encoding scheme. The format uses a block concept
    to describe frequently occurring special features of carbohydrate sequences like
    repeating units. It exists in two variants, a condensed form and a more verbose
    XML syntax. Sorting rules assure the uniqueness of the condensed form, thus making
    it suitable as a direct primary key for database applications, which rely on unique
    identifiers. GlycoCT encompasses the capabilities of the heterogeneous landscape
    of digital encoding schemata in glycomics and is thus a step forward on the way
    to a unified and broadly accepted sequence format in glycobioinformatics.

  publication: doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2012.02.001
  purpose_detail: The Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems Version 2.10 is the latest
    version of a formalism for clinical knowledge representation that can be used
    by clinicians, knowledge engineers, administrators and others to implement clinical
    decision support (CDS) solutions to help improve the quality and safety of care.
    Arden Syntax can be used to create a knowledge base for CDS systems that, when
    coupled with patient data, can generate patient-specific CDS interventions for
    improving patient care. The key change in Version 2.10 over Version 2.9 is inclusion
    of a normative XML representation for Arden Syntax. This was done because the
    use of XML facilitates the development of tools such as syntax checkers and editors
    that can help increase the correctness of executable knowledge modules, and this
    in turn will foster the augmentation of the development and production environments
    for Arden, thereby increasing its utility.

  name: GHP
  publication: doi:10.1093/jamia/ocab196
  purpose_detail: Currently, it is common that a single data element is used to capture
    both sex and gender information, often assuming these two items are one unified
    idea. This specification challenges that notion and proposes that independent
    consideration of sex and gender, and the assessment of their differences promotes
    the health of women, men, and people of diverse gender identities of all ages,
    avoiding systematic errors that generate results with a low validity (if any)
    in clinical studies. The Gender Harmony model describes an approach that can improve
    data accuracy for sex and gender information in health care systems.

  purpose_detail: The JCAMP-DX was one of the earliest specifications providing a
    standard file format for data exchange in mass spectrometry. It was initially
    developed for infrared spectrometry and related chemical and physical information
    between spectrometer data systems of different manufacture. It was also used later
    for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. JCAMP-DX is an ASCII based format
    and therefore not very compact even though it includes standards for file compression.
    All data are stored as labeled fields of variable length using printable ASCII
    characters. JCAMP-DX was officially released in 1988. JCAMP-DX was found impractical
    for today's large MS data sets, but it is still used for exchanging moderate numbers
    of spectra. IUPAC is currently in charge of its maintenance and the latest protocol
    is from 2005.

  purpose_detail: This document is a standard that addresses the representation of
    gene expression data and relevant annotations, as well as mechanisms for exchanging
    these data. The field of gene expression experiments has several distinct technologies
    that a standard must include (e.g., single vs. dual channel experiments, cDNA
    vs. oligonucleotides). Because of these different technologies and different types
    of gene expression experiments, it is not expected that all aspects of the standard
    will be used by all organizations. With the acceptance of XML Metadata Interchange
    as an OMG standard it is possible to specify a normative UML model using a tool
    such as Rational Rose that describes the data structures for Gene Expression

  description: MicroArray Gene Expression Markup Language Tab format
  is_open: true
  name: MAGE-TAB
  purpose_detail: Sharing of microarray data within the research community has been
    greatly facilitated by the development of the disclosure and communication standards
    MIAME and MAGE-ML by the FGED Society. However, the complexity of the MAGE-ML
    format has made its use impractical for laboratories lacking dedicated bioinformatics
    support. We propose a simple tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, MAGE-TAB,
    which will become a part of the MAGE microarray data standard and can be used
    for annotating and communicating microarray data in a MIAME compliant fashion.
    MAGE-TAB will enable laboratories without bioinformatics experience or support
    to manage, exchange and submit well-annotated microarray data in a standard format
    using a spreadsheet. The MAGE-TAB format is self-contained, and does not require
    an understanding of MAGE-ML or XML

    multiple alignments at the DNA level between entire genomes. Previously used formats
    are suitable for multiple alignments of single proteins or regions of DNA without
    rearrangements, but would require considerable extension to cope with genomic
    issues such as forward and reverse strand directions, multiple pieces to the alignment,
    and so forth.

  purpose_detail: From 2005-2008 there has existed two separate XML formats for encoding
    raw spectrometer output, mzData developed by the PSI and mzXML developed at the
    Seattle Proteome Center at the Institute for Systems Biology. It was recognized
    that the existence of two separate formats for essentially the same thing generated
    confusion and required extra programming effort. Therefore the PSI, with full
    participation by ISB, has developed a new format by taking the best aspects of
    each of the precursor formats to form a single one. It is intended to replace
    the previous two formats. This new format was originally given a working name
    of dataXML. The final name is mzML.

  purpose_detail: The mzQuantML standard format is intended to store the systematic
    description of workflows quantifying molecules (principly peptides and proteins)
    by mass spectrometry. A large number of different software packages are available
    that produce output in a variety of different formats. It is intended that mzQuantML
    will provide a common format for the export of identification results from any
    software package. The format was originally developed under the name AnalysisXML
    as a format for several types of computational analyses performed over mass spectra
    in the proteomics context. It has been decided to split development into two formats,
    mzIdentML for peptide and protein identification and mzQuantML (described here),
    covering quantitative proteomic data derived from MS. The development of mzQuantML
    is driven by some general principles, specific use cases and the goal of supporting
    specific techniques, as listed below. These were discussed and agreed at the development
    meeting in Tubingen in July 2011.

    At times, this results in decisions that are not based in relational database
    modeling principles such as normalization. The model is designed to facilitate
    routine and rapid execution of distributed complex analytics. To meet this design
    requirement, some fields are duplicated across multiple tables to support faster
    analytic operations for distributed querying. The PCORnet CDM is based on the
    FDA Mini-Sentinel CDM. This allows PCORnet to more easily leverage the large array
    of analytic tools and expertise developed for the MSCDM v4.0, including data characterization
    approaches and the various tools for complex distributed analytics.

    describes one entire collection. Collection descriptions are electronic records
    that document the holdings of an organisation as groups of items, which complement
    the more traditional item-level records such as are produced for a single specimen
    or a library book. NCD is tailored to natural history. It lies between general
    resource discovery standards such as Dublin Core (DC) and rich collection description
    standards such as the Encoded Archival Description (EAD). The NCD standard covers
    all types of natural history collections, such as specimens, original artwork,
    archives, observations, library materials, datasets, photographs or mixed collections
    such as those that result from expeditions and voyages of discovery.

    processes that generated the data (i.e. provenance). This information can be converted
    to RDF and therefore queried using SPARQL. This representation allows machine
    accessible representations of brain imaging data and will provide links to related

    that the stored data could not be unambiguously interpreted. Although the file
    was used by many different imaging software, the lack of adequate information
    on orientation obliged some, most notably spm, to include, for every analyze file,
    an accompanying file describing the orientation, such as a file with extension
    .mat.

  purpose_detail: "nmrML is an open mark-up language for NMR data. It is currently\
    \ under heavy development and is not yet ready for public use. The development\
    \ of this standard is coordinated by Workpackage 2 of the COSMOS - COordination\
    \ Of Standards In MetabOlomicS Project. COSMOS is a global effort to enable free\
    \ and open sharing of metabolomics data. Coordinated by Dr Christoph Steinbeck\
    \ of the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute, COSMOS brings together European\
    \ data providers to set and promote community standards that will make it easier\
    \ to disseminate metabolomics data through life science e-infrastructures. This\
    \ Coordination Action has been financed with \u20AC2 million by the European Commission's\
    \ Seventh Framework Programme. The nmrML data standard will be approved by the\
    \ Metabolomics Standards Initiative and was derived from an earlier nmrML that\
    \ was developed by the Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC)."

  is_open: true
  name: ORION
  publication: doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70082-8
  purpose_detail: The quality of research in hospital epidemiology (infection control)
    must be improved to be robust enough to influence policy and practice. In order
    to raise the standards of research and publication, a CONSORT equivalent for these
    largely quasi-experimental studies has been prepared by the authors of two relevant
    systematic reviews undertaken for the HTA and the Cochrane Collaboration. The
    statement was revised following widespread consultation with learned societies,
    editors of journals and researchers. It consists of a 22 item checklist, and a
    summary table. The emphasis is on transparency to improve the quality of reporting
    and on the use of appropriate statistical techniques.The statement has been endorsed
    and welcomed by a number of professional special interest groups and societies
    including the Association of Medical Microbiologists (AMM), Bristish Society for
    Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and the Infection Control Nurses' Association
    (ICNA) Research and Development Group. Like CONSORT, ORION considers itself a
    work in progress, which requires ongoing dialogue for successful promotion and
    dissemination. The statement is therefore offered for further public discussion
    and journals are encouraged to trial it as part of their reviewing and editing
    process and feedback to the authors.

    of this format is useful to search against sequnce databases to find out other
    proteins which share the same motif. This HMM file should not be edited manually
    (especially the matrix part) because it contains consistent numerical model as
    a whole.

  description: qcML format
  is_open: true
  name: qcML
  publication: doi:10.1074/mcp.M113.035907
  purpose_detail: An XML format for quality-related data of mass spectrometry and
    other high-throughput experiments. Quality control is increasingly recognized
    as a crucial aspect of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Several recent papers
    discuss relevant parameters for quality control and present applications to extract
    these from the instrumental raw data. What has been missing, however, is a standard
    data exchange format for reporting these performance metrics. We therefore developed
    the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the
    related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics
    Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for
    the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format
    and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational
    storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe
    the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example
    of the subsequent analysis possibilities. All information about qcML is available
    at http://code.google.com/p/qcml

  description: Real-time PCR Data Markup Language
  is_open: true
  name: RDML
  purpose_detail: The RDML file format is developed by the RDML consortium (http://www.rdml.org)
    and can be used free of charge. The RDML file format was created to encourage
    the exchange, publication, revision and re-analysis of raw qPCR data. The core
    of an RDML file is an experiment, not a PCR run. Therefore all the information
    is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the
    file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master
    elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure
    allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to
    provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a
    structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR)
    data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the
    experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard
    is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent
    exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data
    analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors,
    peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this
    standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well
    as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import
    and export of RDML data files.

  formal_specification: https://www.equator-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REMARK-checklist-for-EQUATOR-website-002.docx
  is_open: true
  name: REMARK
  publication: doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6602678
  purpose_detail: Despite years of research and hundreds of reports on tumor markers
    in oncology, the number of markers that have emerged as clinically useful is pitifully
    small. Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent
    studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand
    in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt
    to understand the reasons why multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing
    conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these
    discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported
    in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information
    to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability
    of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker
    studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation
    for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on
    Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized
    trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines
    to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses,
    patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis
    methods. In addition, the guidelines provide helpful suggestions on how to present
    data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines
    is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information
    will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and
    understand the context in which the conclusions apply.

  publication: doi:10.1002/gepi.20410
  purpose_detail: Making sense of rapidly evolving evidence on genetic associations
    is crucial to making genuine advances in human genomics and the eventual integration
    of this information in the practice of medicine and public health. Assessment
    of the strengths and weaknesses of this evidence, and hence the ability to synthesize
    it, has been limited by inadequate reporting of results. The STrengthening the
    REporting of Genetic Association studies (STREGA) initiative builds on the Strengthening
    the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement and
    provides additions to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The additions
    concern population stratification, genotyping errors, modelling haplotype variation,
    Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, replication, selection of participants, rationale
    for choice of genes and variants, treatment effects in studying quantitative traits,
    statistical methods, relatedness, reporting of descriptive and outcome data, and
    the volume of data issues that are important to consider in genetic association
    studies. The STREGA recommendations do not prescribe or dictate how a genetic
    association study should be designed but seek to enhance the transparency of its
    reporting, regardless of choices made during design, conduct, or analysis.

  purpose_detail: STROBE stands for an international, collaborative initiative of
    epidemiologists, methodologists, statisticians, researchers and journal editors
    involved in the conduct and dissemination of observational studies, with the common
    aim of STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology. The
    STROBE Statement is being endorsed by a growing number of biomedical journals.
    Incomplete and inadequate reporting of research hampers the assessment of the
    strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the medical literature. Readers
    need to know what was planned (and what was not), what was done, what was found,
    and what the results mean. Recommendations on the reporting of studies that are
    endorsed by leading medical journals can improve the quality of reporting.Observational
    research comprises several study designs and many topic areas. We aimed to establish
    a checklist of items that should be included in articles reporting such research
    - the STROBE Statement. We considered it reasonable to initially restrict the
    recommendations to the three main analytical designs that are used in observational
    research - cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We want to provide
    guidance on how to report observational research well. Our recommendations are
    not prescriptions for designing or conducting studies. Also, the checklist is
    not an instrument to evaluate the quality of observational research.

    species, and their interactions (including reactions). SBML is a common format
    that many systems biology software understand and thus it has become the way in
    which models are shared and communicated. Despite the popularity of SBML, that
    has resulted in many models being available in electronic format, there is currently
    no standard way of communicating the results of the operations carried out with
    such models (e.g. simulations). Here we propose a new markup language which is
    complementary to SBML and which is intended to specify results from operations
    carried out on models SBRML. In fact, this markup language is useful also to communicate
    experimental data as long as it is possible to express the data in terms of a
    reference SBML model. Thus SBRML is a means of specifying quantitative results
    in the context of a systems biology model.

  formal_specification: https://github.com/tdwg/tcs
  has_relevant_organization:

  is_open: true
  name: TCS
  purpose_detail: The development of an abstract model for a taxonomic concept, which
    can capture the various models represented and understood by the various data
    providers, is central to this project. This model is presented as an XML schema
    document that is proposed as a standard to allow exchange of data between different
    data models. It aims to capture data as understood by the data owners without
    distortion, and facilitate the query of different data resources according to
    the common schema model. The TCS schema was conceived to allow the representation
    of taxonomic concepts as defined in published taxonomic classifications, revisions
    and databases. As such, it specifies the structure for XML documents to be used
    for the transfer of defined concepts. Valid transfer documents may either explicitly
    detail the defining components of taxon concepts, transfer GUIDs referring to
    defined taxon concepts (if and when these are available) or a mixture of the two.

  description: VarioML format
  formal_specification: https://github.com/VarioML/VarioML
  is_open: true
  name: VarioML
  purpose_detail: A Locus-specific Database (LSDB) describes the variants discovered
    on a single gene or members of a gene family and other related functional elements.
    LSDBs are curated by experts on their respective loci, and as such are typically
    the best resources of such information available. But LSDBs vary widely in format
    and completeness, making data integration and exchange among them difficult and
    time-consuming. To address these difficulties, the VarioML format has been developed
    for the full range of variation data use-cases, providing semantically well-defined
    components which can be easily composed to fit specific needs. Using VarioML,
    data owners can now efficiently enable the integration, federation, and exchange
    of their variant data. The discoverabiliaty, extensibility, and quality of variation
    data is immediately enhanced. Critical new avenues of research and knowledge discovery
    are opened, as data using the VarioML standard can be integrated with the global
    library of purely genetic data. VarioML is a central prerequisite for effective
    modelling of phenotype data and genotype-to-phenotype relationships. It removes
    the long-standing technical obstacles to the effective passing of variant data
    from discovery laboratories into the biomedical database world. Now all that is
    needed is the broad participation of the genotype-to-phenotype research community.

  purpose_detail: TDWG vocabularies are a collection of standardized terms and their

    (TDWG) standards in that they are likely to change more often over time as they
    evolve to meet the changing needs of the biodiversity informatics community. These
    changes may be incremental, making it impractical to apply the full TDWG standards
    process to every change. The TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification details
    the categories of changes that can be made to a TDWG vocabulary standard, the
    mechanisms used to achieve those changes, and the entities that are responsible
    for shepherding those changes through the process.

    final version. This final version was administered to 63 consecutive patients
    on two occasions in an attempt to assess test-retest stability, which proved to
    be strong. The findings of the latter analysis demonstrated that a change between
    two administrations of 18 points represents a significant shift in psychosocial

    both very simple service implementations where the provider only responds to a
    set of pre-defined queries, or more advanced implementations where the provider
    software can dynamically parse complex queries referencing output models supplied
    by the client.

  purpose_detail: The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation
    languages or ontology languages for authoring ontologies or knowledge bases. The
    languages are characterized by formal semantics and RDF/XML-based serializations
    for the Semantic Web. OWL is endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and
    has attracted academic, medical and commercial interest. The OWL 2 Web Ontology
    Language, informally OWL 2, is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with
    formally defined meaning. OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals,
    and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can
    be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves
    are primarily exchanged as RDF documents.

  purpose_detail: The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is a way to specify data
    processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. WDL makes it
    straightforward to define analysis tasks, chain them together in workflows, and
    parallelize their execution. The language makes common patterns simple to express,
    while also admitting uncommon or complicated behavior; and strives to achieve
    portability not only across execution platforms, but also different types of users.
    Whether one is an analyst, a programmer, an operator of a production system, or
    any other sort of user, WDL should be accessible and understandable.

    \ by the upper. Node color indicates known (gold) or putative novel (purple) systems.\

    \ relative height of each system in the layout is determined based on the predicted\
    \ diameter of the system in MuSIC."

  purpose_detail: To overcome the hurdle of disparate data sources and repositories
    with heterogeneous data formats a metadata crosswalk was initiated, based on existing
    standards. FAIR Principles were included, as well as data format specifications.
    The metadata crosswalk is the foundation of data provision between a Medical Data
    Integration Center (MeDIC) and researchers, providing a selection of metadata
    information for research design and requests. Based on the crosswalk, metadata
    items were prioritized and categorized to demonstrate that not one single predefined
    standard meets all requirements of a MeDIC and only a maximum data set of metadata
    is suitable for use. The development of a convergence format including the maximum
    data set is the anticipated solution for an automated transformation of metadata
    in a MeDIC.

    into dense representations; and a second exploring extracted admission representations
    in a recurrent-based architecture, where patient trajectories are processed in
    sub-sequences using a sliding window mechanism.

    Neural Network-Based Assistive Diagnosis System for COVID-19 Case Detection from
    Chest X-Ray Images
  has_relevant_organization:

  publication: doi:10.48550/arXiv.2203.10596
  purpose_detail: One of the critical tools for early detection and subsequent evaluation
    of the incidence of lung diseases is chest radiography. This study presents a
    real-world implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based Carebot
    Covid app to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Our proposed model
    takes the form of a simple and intuitive application. Used CNN can be deployed
    as a STOW-RS prediction endpoint for direct implementation into DICOM viewers.

  name: Papez2022
  publication: doi:10.1093/jamia/ocac203
  purpose_detail: We converted UK Biobank data to OMOP CDM v. 5.3. We transformed
    participant research data on diseases collected at recruitment and electronic
    health records (EHR) from primary care, hospitalizations, cancer registrations,
    and mortality from providers in England, Scotland, and Wales. We performed syntactic
    and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk factors between source
    and transformed data.

  description: FastAI
  is_open: true
  name: FastAI
  purpose_detail: fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with
    high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results
    in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components
    that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things
    without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This
    is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common
    underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms
    of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly
    by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility
    of the PyTorch library.

  purpose_detail: The GIS toolchain consists of extensions to the OMOP schema, extensions
    to the OMOP Vocabulary, and GIS-specific software for acquiring and working with
    geospatial data. Together, these enable researchers to use health-related attributes
    of the regions where patients live in OHDSI study cohort definitions. For example,
    you can use the GIS toolchain to define cohorts that include regional data on
    exposure to toxicants or social deprivation along with EHR data on relevant health
    outcomes. The toolchain also includes informatics resources that support integration
    with the main OHDSI tool stack (HADES) and integration with externally supported
    solutions for geocoding and for finding and deriving relevant data sources from
    catalogs of available data sources. Importantly, the toolchain allows integrated
    analysis of geospatial and EHR data without sharing any sensitive patient location
    data.

  is_open: true
  name: MI-CDM
  publication: doi:10.1007/s10278-024-00982-6
  purpose_detail: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning
    techniques require access to large inter-institutional cohorts of data to enable
    the development of robust models, e.g., targeting the identification of disease
    biomarkers and quantifying disease progression and treatment efficacy. The Observational
    Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) has been designed to
    accommodate a harmonized representation of observational healthcare data. This
    study proposes the Medical Imaging CDM (MI-CDM) extension, adding two new tables
    and two vocabularies to the OMOP CDM to address the structural and semantic requirements
    to support imaging research. The tables provide the capabilities of linking DICOM
    data sources as well as tracking the provenance of imaging features derived from
    those images. The implementation of the extension enables phenotype definitions
    using imaging features and expanding standardized computable imaging biomarkers.
    This proposal offers a comprehensive and unified approach for conducting imaging
    research and outcome studies utilizing imaging features.
