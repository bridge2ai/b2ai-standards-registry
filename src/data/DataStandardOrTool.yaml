  description: Access to Biological Collections Data Schema
  is_open: true
  name: ABCD
  purpose_detail: The Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD) Schema is an evolving
    comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens
    and observations (a.k.a. primary biodiversity data). The ABCD Schema attempts
    to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide variety
    of databases. It is compatible with several existing data standards. Parallel
    structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated.
    Version 1.2 is currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information
    Facility) and BioCASE (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe) networks.
    Apart from the GBIF and BioCASE networks, the potential for the application of
    ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets
    from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's
    own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible). By defining relations
    between terms, ABCD is a step towards an ontology for biological collections.

  name: AnIML
  purpose_detail: The Analytical Information Markup Language (AnIML) is the emerging
    ASTM XML standard for analytical chemistry data. It is currently in pre-release
    form. It is a combination of a highly flexible core schema that defines XML tagging
    for any kind of analytical information; A set of technique definition documents.
    These XML files, one per analytical technique, apply tight constraints to the
    flexible core and in turn are defined by the Technique Schema; Extensions to Technique
    Definitions are possible to accommodate vendor- and institution-specific data
    fields. Mission Statement Our goal is to serve as the open-source development
    platform for a new XML standard for Analytical Chemistry Information. The project
    is a collaborative effort between many groups and individuals and is sanctioned

  purpose_detail: 'The Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) project is the first initiative
    to propose and create a standard means of adding information and knowledge to
    medical images in a clinical environment, enabling automatic searching of image
    content. AIM provides a comprehensive solution to imaging challenges including
    the lack of agreed-upon syntax for annotation and markup, standardized semantics
    for annotations, and common formats for annotations and markup. The AIM Model
    captures descriptive information for images with user-generated graphical symbols
    into a single common information source. The project includes multiple components:
    the AIM Template Service (a web service for uploading and downloading AIM templates),
    the AIM Template Builder (a Java application for creating templates with well-defined
    questions and answer choices), and reference implementations like AIM on ClearCanvas
    Workstation. AIM captures results in terms of image regions of interest, semantic
    descriptions, inferences, calculations, and quantitative features derived by computer
    programs. It is interoperable with DICOM-SR and HL7-CDA standards while providing
    unique advantages through an explicit semantic model of imaging results.'

  name: ADL
  purpose_detail: ADL (Archetype Definition Language) provides a formal, human-readable

    It enables the definition of reusable archetypes that constrain generic reference
    models (such as openEHR's) to represent specific clinical concepts like blood
    pressure measurements or problem lists. The language consists of cADL (constraint
    ADL) for structural definitions, dADL (data ADL) for metadata and terminology
    bindings, and an assertion language for business rules. ADL archetypes support
    multi-lingual terminology, specialization hierarchies, and versioning, making
    them suitable for creating maintainable, semantically interoperable health information
    systems. Tools exist for authoring, compiling, and validating ADL archetypes,
    with XML exchange formats also supported. The syntax is designed to be accessible
    to both clinical domain experts and technical implementers.

  description: Axt Alignment Format
  is_open: true
  name: Axt
  purpose_detail: The Axt (Alignment eXTended) format is a simple text-based format
    developed by UCSC Genome Browser for storing pairwise DNA sequence alignments
    between two species or sequences. Each alignment block in an Axt file consists
    of four lines - a summary line containing alignment number, chromosome names,
    alignment start and end positions for both sequences, strand information, and
    alignment score, followed by the aligned sequence from the first genome, the aligned
    sequence from the second genome, and a blank separator line. The format uses zero-based
    coordinates for the first sequence and supports alignments on either strand, with
    sequences from the negative strand reverse-complemented. Axt files are particularly
    useful for representing whole-genome alignments between species (such as human-mouse
    or human-chimp comparisons) generated by alignment tools like BLASTZ or LASTZ.
    The format's straightforward structure makes it easy to parse programmatically
    and convert to other formats. UCSC provides utilities including axtToMaf for converting
    to MAF (Multiple Alignment Format), axtChain for chaining together alignments,
    and axtBest for selecting the best alignment for each position. While Axt efficiently
    represents pairwise alignments, it has been largely superseded by MAF and chain/net
    formats for more complex multi-way alignments and hierarchical alignment representations
    in comparative genomics workflows.

  description: Big Browser Extensible Data Format
  is_open: true
  name: bigBed
  purpose_detail: The bigBed format is an indexed binary format for storing genome
    annotation data, developed by UCSC Genome Browser as a high-performance alternative
    to text-based BED files for large datasets. BigBed files store annotation items
    representing either simple genomic features or linked collections of exons, maintaining
    BED semantics while enabling efficient region-specific data transfer. Files are
    created using the bedToBigBed utility which converts sorted BED files into compressed
    binary format with built-in indexing, requiring chromosome sizes files and optionally
    AutoSql (.as) format definitions for describing standard and custom fields. The
    format supports BED3 through BED12 plus additional user-defined fields, with features
    including itemRgb color specification, extra searchable indices via the -extraIndex
    parameter for track hub item searches, and trackDb settings for mouseOver labels,
    field filtering, and URL transformations. Only the portions of bigBed files needed
    for the currently displayed chromosomal region are transferred to the browser,
    dramatically improving performance compared to full BED file loading. The format
    supports web-accessible hosting via HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP with sparse file caching,
    and includes utilities (bigBedToBed, bigBedInfo, bigBedSummary) for extracting
    and querying data. BigBed files are widely used in UCSC Genome Browser custom
    tracks, track hubs for consortia data sharing, and integrated with genome analysis
    workflows requiring scalable annotation storage and rapid genomic region queries.

  description: Big Wiggle Format
  is_open: true
  name: bigWig
  purpose_detail: The bigWig format is an indexed binary file format developed by
    UCSC for efficient storage and visualization of dense, continuous genomic data
    displayed as graphs in genome browsers. Created from wiggle (wig) or bedGraph
    files using the wigToBigWig or bedGraphToBigWig utilities, bigWig files enable
    rapid data access by transferring only the portions needed to display specific
    genomic regions, rather than entire datasets. This sparse file caching mechanism
    provides dramatically faster performance than text-based formats when working
    with large-scale datasets such as ChIP-seq, RNA-seq coverage, methylation levels,
    or conservation scores. The format supports various visualization options including
    customizable graph types (bar or points), scaling parameters, smoothing windows,
    logarithmic transformations, and color schemes. BigWig files can also display
    sequence logos using the dynseq feature, which scales nucleotide characters by
    base-resolution scores. The format includes utilities for data extraction (bigWigToBedGraph,
    bigWigToWig, bigWigSummary, bigWigAverageOverBed) and file inspection (bigWigInfo),
    making it suitable for both visualization and downstream computational analysis.

  is_open: true
  name: BAM/CRAM
  purpose_detail: BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) and CRAM (Compressed Reference-oriented
    Alignment Map) are binary formats for storing DNA sequence alignments to reference
    genomes, maintained by the GA4GH Large Scale Genomics work stream. BAM is the
    binary equivalent of the text-based SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, providing
    efficient storage and retrieval of aligned sequencing reads with quality scores,
    alignment positions, CIGAR strings, and optional tags defined in the SAMtags specification.
    CRAM (currently version 3.x) achieves superior compression ratios by storing differences
    from a reference sequence rather than full sequence data, using custom compression
    codecs detailed in the CRAMcodecs specification. Both formats support indexing
    (BAI for BAM, CRAI for CRAM, and CSI as a more scalable successor) enabling rapid
    random access to genomic regions. The formats are widely supported by genomics
    toolkits including samtools, htslib, htsjdk, and GATK, with standard operations
    for sorting, merging, filtering, and format conversion. CRAM offers significant
    storage savings particularly important for large-scale projects, while maintaining
    full compatibility with SAM/BAM workflows. Both formats support the htsget protocol
    for parallel streaming access and can be wrapped with crypt4gh encryption for
    secure data sharing.

      across multiple sequencing technologies. The model transforms aligned reads
      into image-like pileup tensors that capture base qualities, mapping qualities,
      and strand information, enabling the CNN to learn complex patterns that distinguish
      true genetic variants from sequencing artifacts and alignment errors. This approach
      achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and generalizes
      well across Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms without
      technology-specific parameter tuning.

      resistance. These models improve sensitivity for detecting variants in repetitive
      regions and provide better breakpoint resolution than conventional methods.

  description: Biological Expression Language
  formal_specification: https://language.bel.bio/
  is_open: true
  name: BEL
  purpose_detail: The Biological Expression Language (BEL) is a domain-specific language
    for representing scientific findings from life sciences literature in a computable,
    structured format. BEL captures causal and correlative relationships between biological
    entities (genes, proteins, complexes, biological processes, pathways) along with
    their experimental and publication context, enabling systematic knowledge representation
    and integration. BEL statements are expressed as triples (subject-relationship-object)
    that can be combined into biological networks and knowledge graphs. Each BEL assertion
    is packaged as a "nanopub" that includes provenance information, experimental
    conditions, and citations, allowing relationships to be properly evaluated in
    context. The language supports standard biological nomenclatures (Gene Ontology,
    HGNC, ChEBI, etc.) through namespace integration and provides a simplified syntax
    that is more accessible than traditional chemical notation. BEL's computable format
    enables applications in reverse causal reasoning, heat diffusion algorithms, prior
    knowledge for machine learning models, and detection of contradictory findings
    across literature. The standard is maintained by the BEL Language Committee with
    updates managed through BEL Enhancement Proposals (BEPs).

    to improve the findability and discoverability of life sciences resources on the
    web through structured markup. The project makes two main contributions to the
    life sciences community - proposing new types and properties to Schema.org specifically
    for life science resources, and defining usage profiles over existing Schema.org
    types that specify essential, recommended, and optional properties for consistent
    markup. Bioschemas profiles significantly simplify the markup process by reducing
    complex Schema.org types to manageable subsets while ensuring compatibility with
    search engines like Google Dataset Search. The initiative has achieved major recognition
    with six Bioschemas types (BioChemEntity, ChemicalSubstance, Gene, MolecularEntity,
    Protein, Taxon) officially included in Schema.org version 13.0. Endorsed by the
    European Research Council and serving as a flagship policy of ELIXIR, Bioschemas
    supports FAIR data principles by enabling automated discovery, collation, and
    analysis of distributed life sciences resources including datasets, software applications,
    training materials, and biological entities across the web ecosystem.

  publication: doi:10.1002/cncy.20147
  purpose_detail: Human biospecimens are subject to a number of different collection,
    processing, and storage factors that can significantly alter their molecular composition
    and consistency. These biospecimen preanalytical factors, in turn, influence experimental
    outcomes and the ability to reproduce scientific results. Currently, the extent
    and type of information specific to the biospecimen preanalytical conditions reported
    in scientific publications and regulatory submissions varies widely. To improve
    the quality of research utilizing human tissues, it is critical that information
    regarding the handling of biospecimens be reported in a thorough, accurate, and
    standardized manner. The Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality (BRISQ)
    recommendations outlined herein are intended to apply to any study in which human
    biospecimens are used. The purpose of reporting these details is to supply others,
    from researchers to regulators, with more consistent and standardized information
    to better evaluate, interpret, compare, and reproduce the experimental results.
    The BRISQ guidelines are proposed as an important and timely resource tool to
    strengthen communication and publications around biospecimen-related research
    and help reassure patient contributors and the advocacy community that the contributions
    are valued and respected

  name: BED
  purpose_detail: The Browser Extensible Data (BED) format is a flexible, tab-delimited
    text format designed for defining annotation tracks in genome browsers, particularly
    the UCSC Genome Browser. BED format provides a standardized way to represent genomic
    features with positional information, supporting both simple coordinate-based
    annotations and complex multi-exon structures. The format consists of 12 possible
    fields, with the first three (chromosome, start position, end position) being
    mandatory and nine additional optional fields providing detailed feature information
    including name, score, strand orientation, thick start/end coordinates for coding
    regions, RGB color values for visualization, and block structures for representing
    discontinuous features like exons and introns. BED files use zero-based, half-open
    coordinate system where the start position is inclusive and the end position is
    exclusive, enabling precise genomic interval representation. The format supports
    various annotation types from simple genomic intervals to complex gene models,
    making it essential for genomic data visualization, comparative genomics, and
    functional annotation workflows in bioinformatics research.

  description: CDISC Case Report Tabulation Data Definition Specification
  is_open: true
  name: Define
  purpose_detail: The CDISC Case Report Tabulation Data Definition Specification (define.xml)
    Version 1.0 reflects changes from a comment period through the Health Level 7
    (HL7) Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Technical Committee (RCRIM)
    in December 2003 (www.hl7.org) and CDISC's website in September 2004 as well as
    the work done by the define.xml team in conjunction with the CDISC ODM team to
    add functionality, features, and additional documentation. This document specifies
    the standard for providing Case Report Tabulations Data Definitions in an XML
    format for submission to regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA). The XML schema used
    to define the expected structure for these XML files is based on an extension
    to the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM). The 1999 FDA electronic submission
    (eSub) guidance and the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) documents
    specify that a document describing the content and structure of the included data
    should be provided within a submission. This document is known as the Data Definition
    Document (e.g., define.pdf in the 1999 guidance). The Data Definition Document
    provides a list of the datasets included in the submission along with a detailed
    description of the contents of each dataset. To increase the level of automation
    and improve the efficiency of the Regulatory Review process, define.xml can be
    used to provide the Data Definition Document in a machine-readable format.

  formal_specification: https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/
  is_open: true
  name: CDASH
  purpose_detail: The Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) is
    a CDISC foundational standard that establishes consistent data collection practices
    across clinical studies and sponsors. CDASH provides a standardized framework
    for designing case report forms (CRFs) and electronic data capture (eCRF) systems
    by defining a common set of data collection fields and structures. The standard
    specifies field names, labels, prompt questions, and controlled terminology for
    capturing clinical observations, ensuring that data can be directly traced to
    the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) without extensive post-collection transformation.
    By harmonizing data collection at the source, CDASH reduces data cleaning efforts,
    improves data quality, and accelerates the transition from collection to analysis.
    The standard covers various therapeutic areas and data domains including demographics,
    vital signs, adverse events, concomitant medications, and laboratory results.
    CDISC provides a library of ready-to-use, CDASH-compliant annotated eCRFs in multiple
    formats (PDF, HTML, XML) that can be implemented as-is or customized for specific
    study needs, facilitating regulatory submission and data review processes.

  is_open: true
  name: chain
  purpose_detail: The Chain format is a compact file format developed by UCSC for
    representing pairwise genomic sequence alignments that permit gaps in both the
    reference and query sequences simultaneously. Each chain alignment consists of
    a header line specifying score, chromosome identifiers, sizes, strands, and coordinates
    for both sequences, followed by alignment data lines describing ungapped blocks
    and the gaps between them. The format uses zero-based half-open intervals for
    coordinates and includes support for reverse-complement alignments through strand
    indicators. Chain files are particularly useful for comparing whole genomes or
    large genomic regions, representing syntenic relationships, structural variations,
    and evolutionary rearrangements. They are commonly used in genome browsers and
    liftOver tools for mapping genomic coordinates between different genome assemblies
    or between species. The format supports "snake" or rearrangement display modes
    that visualize complex structural variants including inversions, duplications,
    and translocations. Chain alignments can be produced by tools like BLASTZ and
    are widely used in comparative genomics workflows.

  description: Chemical Markup Language
  is_open: true
  name: CML
  purpose_detail: CML (Chemical Markup Language) is an XML language designed to hold
    most of the central concepts in chemistry. It was the first language to be developed
    and plays the same role for chemistry as MathML for mathematics and GML for geographical
    systems. CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules, reactions,
    solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a special flexible approach
    to numeric science it also covers a very wide range of chemical properties, parameters
    and experimental observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication
    between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been heavily informed
    by the current chemical scholarly literature and chemical databases. XML is a
    mainstream approach providing semantics for science, such as MathML, SBML/BIOPAX
    (biology), GML and KML (geo) SVG (graphics) and NLM-DTD, ODT and OOXML (documents).
    CML provides support for most chemistry, especially molecules, compounds, reactions,
    spectra, crystals and computational chemistry (compchem). CML has been developed
    by Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa since 1995. It is the de facto XML for chemistry,
    accepted by publishers and with more than 1 million lines of Open Source code
    supporting it. CML can be validated and built into authoring tools (for example
    the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Word). A list of CML-compliant and CML-aware
    software can be found on the software page. The infrastructure includes legacy
    converters, dictionaries and conventions, Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. There
    are several versions of the CML schema. The most recent schema is schema 3. This
    essentially relaxes many of the constraints imposed in the previous stable release
    (schema 2.4), allowing users to put together the elements and attributes in a
    more flexible manner to fit the data that they want to represent more easily.

  is_open: true
  name: ClinGen Interpretation
  purpose_detail: The ClinGen Interpretation Model is a comprehensive data model and
    exchange format designed to capture, structure, and communicate the clinical interpretation
    of genetic variants. It supports the representation of evidence, reasoning, provenance,
    and contextual information underlying variant pathogenicity assessments, aligning
    with ACMG/AMP guidelines and community standards. The model enables detailed documentation
    of what evidence was used, how it was applied, who performed each interpretive
    act, and how interpretations build upon prior knowledge. It is flexible enough
    to represent both simple assertions and fully evidence-based interpretations,
    and is implemented using industry-standard JSON-LD for interoperability. The ClinGen
    Interpretation Model is closely aligned with the Monarch Initiative's SEPIO ontology,
    supporting integration with other biomedical data models and facilitating automated
    reasoning, reproducibility, and data sharing in clinical genomics.

    description: ClinGen Interpretation standard is used in AI applications for training
      machine learning models on expert-curated variant classifications and clinical
      evidence, enabling automated variant interpretation following ACMG/AMP guidelines.
      AI systems leverage ClinGen's structured assertions about variant pathogenicity,
      disease associations, and supporting evidence to learn patterns in clinical
      reasoning, predict pathogenicity of novel variants, and suggest appropriate
      ACMG criteria for variant classification. The standard enables AI applications
      that assist clinical geneticists in variant interpretation, prioritize variants
      for manual review, and ensure consistency in classification across laboratories.
      Machine learning models trained on ClinGen data can identify conflicts in variant
      interpretation and suggest evidence-based resolutions.

  name: CFDE C2M2
  purpose_detail: The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2)
    is a flexible, extensible data model designed to harmonize metadata across NIH
    Common Fund data coordinating centers (DCCs) to enable integrated search, discovery,
    and analysis. C2M2 provides a standardized framework for describing biomedical
    research assets including files, biosamples, subjects, and collections with their
    associated metadata using controlled vocabularies and ontologies. The model consists
    of core entities (file, biosample, subject, project, collection) connected through
    relationships that capture data provenance, experimental context, and biological
    associations. C2M2 submissions include data tables describing these entities along
    with controlled vocabulary term usage tables that link to standard ontologies
    for enhanced semantic interoperability. The model supports supra-schematic constraints
    validated by dedicated tools, and includes ontology reference files for adding
    display names, descriptions, and synonyms to controlled terms. C2M2 enables the
    CFDE Workbench portal to provide unified search and browsing across heterogeneous
    Common Fund datasets, facilitating cross-program data discovery and promoting
    FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for biomedical
    research data.

  purpose_detail: CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) is an evidence-based
    minimum set of recommendations for reporting randomized controlled trial (RCT)
    results, developed to address inadequate reporting that prevents proper assessment
    of trial quality and generalizability. The CONSORT 2025 Statement consists of
    a 30-item checklist and flow diagram covering how trials are designed, analyzed,
    and interpreted, with detailed recommendations for reporting participant recruitment,
    randomization procedures, interventions, outcomes, sample size calculations, statistical
    methods, baseline characteristics, results for each outcome, harms, interpretation,
    and generalizability. The flow diagram tracks progress of all participants through
    each trial stage (enrollment, allocation, follow-up, analysis) with numbers and
    reasons for exclusions and losses. CONSORT is companion to SPIRIT (Standard Protocol
    Items - Recommendations for Interventional Trials) which provides a 34-item checklist
    for protocol reporting. Both guidelines emphasize transparent and complete reporting
    to enable readers to critically appraise, interpret, and apply research findings.
    CONSORT includes numerous extensions for specific trial designs (cluster randomized,
    non-inferiority, pragmatic trials), interventions (herbal, acupuncture, non-pharmacological
    treatment), and data types. The guidelines are supported by Explanation and Elaboration
    documents with detailed rationale and examples, online tools (COBWEB for report
    writing, SEPTRE for protocol management), translations in multiple languages,
    and endorsement by hundreds of medical journals worldwide as part of the EQUATOR
    Network research reporting standards.

  name: Crypt4GH
  purpose_detail: Crypt4GH is a file format specification developed by the Global
    Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) for secure storage and transmission of
    genomic and health-related data. The format provides end-to-end encryption and
    authentication, allowing sensitive genomic data to be stored in public repositories
    while maintaining confidentiality. It uses modern cryptographic standards including
    Curve25519 for key agreement, ChaCha20 for encryption, and Poly1305 for authentication.
    The format supports multiple recipients through per-recipient encrypted headers,
    enabling controlled data sharing where different users can decrypt the same file
    using their own private keys. Crypt4GH is designed for streaming access, allowing
    applications to decrypt and process data incrementally without loading entire
    files into memory. The format includes metadata protection and supports selective
    decryption of file segments, making it suitable for large-scale genomic datasets.
    Existing bioinformatics tools can be adapted with minimal modifications to read
    and write Crypt4GH-encrypted data, facilitating adoption in genomics workflows.

    a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions
    of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters
    to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially
    in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured
    by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system
    was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use
    by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile
    enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data.
    Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if
    computer processing of the data is not envisaged.

      is used in AI applications to generate structured imaging reports that can be
      integrated into electronic health record systems, enabling AI findings to be
      documented in standards-compliant clinical documents. AI systems leverage this
      specification to produce CDA-formatted reports containing AI-detected findings,
      measurements, and recommendations that can be incorporated into patient records
      alongside traditional radiologist reports. The standard supports AI applications
      that need to communicate results to referring physicians through EHR inboxes,
      contribute to longitudinal patient records, and ensure that AI-generated content
      is available for clinical decision support across the healthcare enterprise,
      not just within radiology systems.

    of a taxon; educationalists, taxonomists, biochemists, anatomists etc. who wish
    to record plant use, often at a broad level; economic botany collection curators
    who need to describe accurately the uses and values of specimens in their collections;
    bibliographers who need to describe plant uses referred to in publications and
    to apply keywords consistently for ease of data retrieval. While this standard
    is still in use, it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the
    TDWG website).

  description: European Data Format
  is_open: true
  name: EDF
  purpose_detail: The European Data Format (EDF) is a simple and flexible format for
    exchange and storage of multichannel biological and physical signals, particularly
    in clinical neurophysiology, sleep medicine, and cardiology. Originally developed
    in 1990 by European biomedical engineers through the "Methodology for the Analysis
    of the Sleep-Wakefulness Continuum" project funded by the European Community,
    EDF became the de-facto standard for EEG and PSG recordings. The format is hardware
    and software independent, supporting various montages, transducers, prefiltering
    options, and sampling frequencies. EDF enables creation of common databases for
    sleep records, comparative analysis of algorithms across laboratories, and standardized
    evaluation of manual and automatic analysis methods. The format has been extended
    to EDF+, which maintains backward compatibility while adding support for interrupted
    recordings, annotations, stimuli, events, and analysis results such as deltaplots,
    QRS parameters, and sleep stages. EDF+ can store any medical recording including
    EMG, evoked potentials, and ECG data, with stricter specifications that enable
    automatic electrode localization and calibration. Both formats are freely available
    and widely adopted in commercial equipment and multicenter research projects.

    Each dimension has 3 levels - no problems, some problems, and extreme problems.
    The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next
    to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision
    results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension.
    The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that

    neonates; subpart C, additional protections for prisoners; and subpart D, additional
    protections for children. Each agency includes in its chapter of the Code of Federal
    Regulations [CFR] section numbers and language that are identical to those of
    the HHS codification at 45 CFR part 46, subpart A. For all participating departments
    and agencies the Common Rule outlines the basic provisions for IRBs, informed
    consent, and Assurances of Compliance. Human subject research conducted or supported
    by each federal department/agency is governed by the regulations of that department/agency.

    describing the entities and agents involved in these processes. Based on the W3C
    Provenance specification, it establishes a critical foundation for assessing authenticity,
    enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility in healthcare data systems. The resource
    supports three key components from W3C Provenance: Entity (physical, digital,
    or conceptual things with fixed aspects), Agent (persons, devices, systems, organizations,
    or care teams bearing responsibility for activities), and Activity (time-bound
    processes that act upon entities). Provenance resources serve as record-keeping
    assertions that capture context information for quality, reliability, and trustworthiness
    assessments. The standard supports multiple use cases including tracking data
    lineage in clinical workflows, enabling audit trails for regulatory compliance,
    supporting clinical decision-making through data origin verification, and facilitating
    data integration from multiple healthcare systems. It includes digital signature
    capabilities for integrity verification and non-repudiation, supports versioning
    and unique identification requirements, and provides mechanisms for recording
    import and transformation activities in healthcare interoperability scenarios."'

    needed to completely describe flow cytometry data sets within the confines of

    as FCS 2.0 and again in 1997 as FCS 3.0. We report here on the next generation
    Flow Cytometry Standard data file format. FCS 3.1 is a minor revision based on
    suggested improvements from the community. The unchanged goal of the Standard
    is to provide a uniform file format that allows files created by one type of acquisition
    hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type.

  name: FACT-G
  purpose_detail: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) is
    a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure four domains of HRQOL in cancer patients
    - Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. Original development
    and validation involved 854 patients with cancer and 15 oncology specialists.
    An initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer
    was generated by open-ended interviews with patients experienced with the symptoms
    of cancer and oncology professionals. Using preselected criteria, items were reduced
    to a 38-item general version. Factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on
    545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 27-item FACT-General
    (FACT-G). Coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. The scale's
    ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance
    status rating (PSR), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity. It has
    also demonstrated sensitivity to change over time.

  is_open: true
  name: Regier2018
  publication: doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06159-4
  purpose_detail: Regier2018 defines whole genome sequencing (WGS) data processing
    standards that enable functional equivalence (FE) across different analysis pipelines
    used by various research groups. These standards establish best practices for
    alignment, variant calling, and quality control steps in genomic analysis workflows,
    allowing different computational implementations to produce concordant results
    while still permitting innovation in pipeline optimization. The framework addresses
    key challenges in large-scale genomic studies by defining expected outputs, quality
    metrics, and validation procedures that ensure harmonized variant calling across
    projects. This standardization is particularly important for collaborative efforts
    like the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), where multiple centers must
    produce comparable data that can be combined for downstream analysis. The standards
    cover reference genome usage, read alignment parameters, variant detection algorithms,
    and filtering criteria, providing a foundation for reproducible genomics research.

  description: Functional Genomics Experiment Markup Language
  is_open: true
  name: FuGE-ML
  purpose_detail: Functional genomics experiments present many challenges in data
    archiving, sharing and querying. As the size and complexity of data generated
    from such experiments grows, so does the requirement for standard data formats.
    To address these needs, the Functional Genomics Experiment [Object Model / Markup-Language]
    (FuGE-OM, FuGE-ML) has been created to facilitate the development of data standards.FuGE
    is a model of the shared components in different functional genomics domains.
    FuGE facilitates the development of data standards in functional genomics in two
    ways. 1. FuGE provides a model of common components in functional genomics investigations,
    such as materials, data, protocols, equipment and software. These models can be
    extended to develop modular data formats with consistent structure. 2. FuGE provides
    a framework for capturing complete laboratory workflows, enabling the integration
    of pre-existing data formats. In this context, FuGE allows the capture of additional
    metadata that gives formats a context within the complete workflow. FuGE is available
    as a UML model and an XML Schema

    description: FuGEFlow is used in AI applications for standardizing functional
      genomics experimental workflows, enabling automated workflow optimization, experimental
      design prediction, and quality control through machine learning. AI systems
      leverage FuGEFlow's formal representation of experimental protocols, data transformations,
      and sample tracking to train models that predict optimal experimental conditions,
      identify protocol deviations that affect data quality, and automate experimental
      planning. The standard supports AI-driven meta-analysis across functional genomics
      studies by ensuring computational reproducibility and enabling models to learn
      from both successful and failed experiments. Applications include automated
      protocol generation, prediction of experimental outcomes based on design parameters,
      and workflow recommendation systems for genomics laboratories.

  formal_specification: https://github.com/ga4gh-metadata/metadata-schemas
  is_open: true
  name: GA4GH
  purpose_detail: The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) metadata model
    provides a standardized framework for representing and sharing genomic and clinical
    data across institutions and international borders, developed by a coalition of
    public and private stakeholders including research institutions, healthcare organizations,
    and technology companies. The model defines schemas for core genomic data types
    including variants, reads, references, annotations, and associated clinical phenotypes,
    using protocol buffers (protobuf) and JSON for interoperable data exchange. GA4GH
    schemas cover reference genomes and sequences, variant calls and annotations (compatible
    with VCF), sequencing reads and alignments (supporting BAM/CRAM), RNA quantification,
    continuous-valued genomic signals, genomic features and annotations, metadata
    about biosamples and individuals, phenotypic information using ontologies, and
    provenance tracking. The framework enables federated data access through APIs
    including hts-get for streaming genomic data, Beacon for discovery queries across
    datasets, Data Repository Service (DRS) for accessing data objects, Task Execution
    Service (TES) for running analysis workflows, and Workflow Execution Service (WES)
    for managing computational pipelines. GA4GH standards facilitate large-scale collaborative
    research initiatives, support FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
    Reusable), enable secure data sharing with privacy-preserving technologies, and
    provide the foundation for international genomics research networks, clinical
    genomics implementations, and precision medicine programs.

  description: Gating-ML specification
  is_open: true
  name: Gating-ML
  purpose_detail: The Gating-ML specification represents a proposal on how to form
    unambiguous XML-based gate definitions that may be used independently as well
    as included as one of the components of ACS. Such a description of gates can facilitate
    the interchange and validation of data between different software packages with
    the potential of significant increase of hardware and software interoperability.
    The specification supports rectangular gates in n dimensions (i.e., from one-dimensional
    range gates up to n-dimensional hyper-rectangular regions), polygon gates in two
    (and more) dimensions, ellipsoid gates in n dimensions, decision tree structures,
    and Boolean collections of any of the types of gates. Gates can be uniquely identified
    and may be ordered into a hierarchical structure to describe a gating strategy.
    Gates may be applied on parameters as in list mode data files (e.g., FCS files)
    or on transformed parameters as described by any explicit parameter transformation.
    Therefore, since version 1.5, parameter transformation and compensation description
    are included as part of the Gating-ML specification.

  description: Gene Prediction File Format
  is_open: true
  name: GenePred
  purpose_detail: The genePred (Gene Prediction) format is a flexible tab-delimited
    table format developed by UCSC Genome Browser for representing gene structure
    predictions and annotations, widely used for storing transcript models, gene predictions
    from ab initio tools, and curated gene annotations. The basic genePred format
    contains 10 required fields - gene name, chromosome, strand, transcription start/end
    positions, coding sequence (CDS) start/end positions, exon count, comma-separated
    exon start positions, and comma-separated exon end positions. Extended versions
    (genePredExt) add fields for unique identifiers, CDS start/end status (complete/incomplete),
    exon frame information for each coding exon, and gene symbols or descriptions.
    The format efficiently represents complex transcript structures including alternative
    splicing isoforms, UTRs (untranslated regions), introns, and partial gene models.
    GenePred files support various gene prediction algorithms (GeneMark, Augustus,
    SNAP), RefSeq annotations, Ensembl gene builds, and GENCODE comprehensive gene
    sets. UCSC provides utilities including genePredToBed for BED format conversion,
    genePredToGtf for GTF conversion, and genePredToPsl for PSL format output. The
    format's compact structure and explicit exon coordinates make it ideal for genome
    browsers, annotation pipelines, and comparative genomics analyses requiring efficient
    storage and rapid retrieval of gene structure information across whole genomes.

  description: Gene Product Annotation Data format
  is_open: true
  name: GPAD
  purpose_detail: The Gene Ontology project provides annotations describing attributes
    of biological entities such as genes and gene products. The Gene Ontology has
    historically provided annotations via Gene Association Format (GAF), including
    GAF-1 and GAF-2. Ontologies are distributed separately, using an OWL serialization
    or OBO format. The use of GAF has some drawbacks. Combined representation of gene/gene
    product data and annotations leads to redundancy/repetition No way to represent
    gene/gene product metadata for unannotated genes Requirement to maintain backward
    compatibility makes it harder to introduce enhancements such as use of an ontology
    for evidence types GAF formats will continue to be supported, but the need for
    a way to represent genes/gene products separately from annotations, as well as
    the need to use the evidence ontology has lead to the creation of the GPAD (Gene
    Product Annotation Data) and GPI (Gene Product Information) formats, defined here.
    Whilst GPAD and GPI have been defined for use within the Gene Ontology Consortium
    for GO annotation, this specification is designed to be reusable for analagous
    ontology-based annotation - for example, gene phenotype annotation.

  name: GFF
  purpose_detail: The General Feature Format (GFF) is a tab-delimited text file format
    developed by the Sequence Ontology Consortium for representing genomic features
    and annotations. GFF3, the current version, provides a flexible structure for
    describing genes, transcripts, exons, regulatory elements, and other sequence
    features with their genomic coordinates, strand orientation, phase information,
    and hierarchical relationships. Each line represents a single feature with nine
    standardized fields including sequence ID, source, feature type (from Sequence
    Ontology terms), start/end positions, score, strand, and attributes. The format
    supports parent-child relationships through ID and Parent attributes, enabling
    representation of complex gene structures with multiple transcripts and alternative
    splicing. GFF3 includes directives for metadata and embedded FASTA sequences.
    The format is widely used by genome browsers (UCSC, Ensembl, JBrowse), annotation
    pipelines, and analysis tools for visualizing and processing genomic data. Its
    human-readable structure and extensive tool support make it a standard choice
    for genome annotation exchange and long-term data archiving.

  publication: doi:10.1016/j.carres.2008.03.011
  purpose_detail: '"GlycoCT (Glyco Connection Table) format is an advanced, comprehensive
    encoding scheme specifically designed to describe complex carbohydrate sequences
    with unprecedented precision and consistency in glycobioinformatics. Developed
    as version 4 (KIROI) by Stephan Herget and Rene Ranzinger in 2007, this format
    employs a controlled vocabulary based on IUPAC nomenclature rules to systematically
    name monosaccharides and utilizes a connection table approach rather than linear
    encoding, enabling accurate representation of branched and complex glycan structures.
    GlycoCT incorporates a sophisticated block concept to efficiently handle frequently
    occurring structural features such as repeating units, which are common in biological
    carbohydrates. The format exists in two complementary variants: a condensed form
    optimized for database applications with strict sorting rules ensuring uniqueness
    for use as primary keys, and a more verbose XML syntax that provides enhanced
    readability and machine processing capabilities. Released under Creative Commons
    Attribution 4.0 International License, GlycoCT represents a significant advancement
    toward achieving a unified and broadly accepted sequence format in glycobioinformatics,
    encompassing the capabilities of the heterogeneous landscape of existing digital
    encoding schemata while providing the foundation for developing ontological relationships
    between glycan structural terms and supporting automated glycan structure analysis."'

  purpose_detail: The 'Herbarium Information Standards and Protocols for Interchange
    of Data' (HISPID) is a standard format for the interchange of electronic herbarium
    specimen information. HISPID has been developed by a committee of representatives
    from all major Australian herbaria. This interchange standard was first published
    in 1989, with a revised version published in 1993./nHISPID3 (version 3) is an
    accession-based interchange standard. Although many fields refer to attributes
    of the taxon they should be construed as applying to the specimen represented
    by the record, not to the taxon per se. The interchange of taxonomic, nomenclatural,
    bibliographic, typification, rare and endangered plant conservation, and other
    related information is not dealt with in this standard, unless it specifically
    refers to a particular accession (record). While this standard is still in use,
    it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the TDWG website).

  is_open: true
  name: Arden
  publication: doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2012.02.001
  purpose_detail: The Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems Version 2.10 is the latest
    version of a formalism for clinical knowledge representation that can be used
    by clinicians, knowledge engineers, administrators and others to implement clinical
    decision support (CDS) solutions to help improve the quality and safety of care.
    Arden Syntax can be used to create a knowledge base for CDS systems that, when
    coupled with patient data, can generate patient-specific CDS interventions for
    improving patient care. The key change in Version 2.10 over Version 2.9 is inclusion
    of a normative XML representation for Arden Syntax. This was done because the
    use of XML facilitates the development of tools such as syntax checkers and editors
    that can help increase the correctness of executable knowledge modules, and this
    in turn will foster the augmentation of the development and production environments
    for Arden, thereby increasing its utility.

  name: Specimen
  purpose_detail: The FHIR Specimen resource provides a standardized structure for
    representing any material sample taken from a biological entity (living or dead)
    or from a physical object or the environment, essential for laboratory testing,
    biobanking, and clinical diagnostics. The resource captures comprehensive specimen
    metadata including type (blood, tissue, urine, etc.), subject/patient association,
    collection details (method, body site, quantity, date/time), identifiers (accession
    number, container ID), processing and handling procedures (centrifugation, fixation,
    storage), parent-child specimen relationships for aliquots and derivatives, storage
    conditions (temperature, humidity), and current status (available, unavailable,
    unsatisfactory, entered-in-error). The resource supports complex laboratory workflows
    by tracking specimen provenance through collection, transport, processing, and
    analysis stages, with fields for collection procedure, additive substances, container
    types, and special handling requirements. Specimen integrates with other FHIR
    resources including Patient, Practitioner, ServiceRequest, DiagnosticReport, and
    Observation to create complete clinical laboratory information workflows. The
    resource enables biobank specimen catalogs, clinical trial sample tracking, public
    health surveillance specimen management, and research biorepository operations.
    FHIR Specimen supports interoperability between laboratory information systems
    (LIS), electronic health records (EHR), biobank management systems, and research
    databases, facilitating standardized specimen data exchange across healthcare
    and research ecosystems while maintaining compliance with regulations for specimen
    handling, consent, and data privacy.

  purpose_detail: Currently, it is common that a single data element is used to capture
    both sex and gender information, often assuming these two items are one unified
    idea. This specification challenges that notion and proposes that independent
    consideration of sex and gender, and the assessment of their differences promotes
    the health of women, men, and people of diverse gender identities of all ages,
    avoiding systematic errors that generate results with a low validity (if any)
    in clinical studies. The Gender Harmony model describes an approach that can improve
    data accuracy for sex and gender information in health care systems.

    medical device communication challenges in clinical settings. The profiles follow
    IHE's technical framework development process including proposal, supplement development,
    public comment, trial implementation at Connectathon events, and finalization.
    Key PCD profiles include ACM (Alert Communication Management) for standardized
    alarm handling, DEC (Device Enterprise Communication) for device-to-enterprise
    integration, IDCO (Implantable Device Cardiac Observations) for cardiac device
    data, IPEC (Infusion Pump Event Communication) for infusion pump safety, PIV (Point
    of Care Infusion Verification) for medication verification, PCIM (Point of Care
    Identity Management) for device authentication, RDQ (Retrospective Data Query)
    for historical data retrieval, RTM (Rosetta Terminology Mapping) for standardized
    device terminology, and WCM (Waveform Communication Module) for physiological
    waveform data. These profiles leverage existing standards like HL7, DICOM, and
    IEEE 11073 to enable vendor-neutral device interoperability, supporting critical
    use cases such as automated vital signs documentation in electronic health records,
    integrated alarm management across monitoring systems, and safe medication administration
    workflows.

  purpose_detail: The JCAMP-DX was one of the earliest specifications providing a
    standard file format for data exchange in mass spectrometry. It was initially
    developed for infrared spectrometry and related chemical and physical information
    between spectrometer data systems of different manufacture. It was also used later
    for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. JCAMP-DX is an ASCII based format
    and therefore not very compact even though it includes standards for file compression.
    All data are stored as labeled fields of variable length using printable ASCII
    characters. JCAMP-DX was officially released in 1988. JCAMP-DX was found impractical
    for today's large MS data sets, but it is still used for exchanging moderate numbers
    of spectra. IUPAC is currently in charge of its maintenance and the latest protocol
    is from 2005.

  name: MINiML
  purpose_detail: MINiML (MIAME Notation in Markup Language, pronounced 'minimal')
    is a data exchange format optimized for microarray gene expression data, as well
    as many other types of high-throughput molecular abundance data. MINiML assumes
    only very basic relations between objects - Platform (e.g., array), Sample (e.g.,
    hybridization), and Series (experiment). MINiML captures all components of the
    MIAME checklist, as well as any additional information that the submitter wants
    to provide. MINiML uses XML Schema as syntax.

  description: MicroArray Gene Expression Markup Language
  is_open: true
  name: MAGE-ML
  purpose_detail: This document is a standard that addresses the representation of
    gene expression data and relevant annotations, as well as mechanisms for exchanging
    these data. The field of gene expression experiments has several distinct technologies
    that a standard must include (e.g., single vs. dual channel experiments, cDNA
    vs. oligonucleotides). Because of these different technologies and different types
    of gene expression experiments, it is not expected that all aspects of the standard
    will be used by all organizations. With the acceptance of XML Metadata Interchange
    as an OMG standard it is possible to specify a normative UML model using a tool
    such as Rational Rose that describes the data structures for Gene Expression

  description: MicroArray Gene Expression Markup Language Tab format
  is_open: true
  name: MAGE-TAB
  purpose_detail: Sharing of microarray data within the research community has been
    greatly facilitated by the development of the disclosure and communication standards
    MIAME and MAGE-ML by the FGED Society. However, the complexity of the MAGE-ML
    format has made its use impractical for laboratories lacking dedicated bioinformatics
    support. We propose a simple tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, MAGE-TAB,
    which will become a part of the MAGE microarray data standard and can be used
    for annotating and communicating microarray data in a MIAME compliant fashion.
    MAGE-TAB will enable laboratories without bioinformatics experience or support
    to manage, exchange and submit well-annotated microarray data in a standard format
    using a spreadsheet. The MAGE-TAB format is self-contained, and does not require
    an understanding of MAGE-ML or XML

      standardized representation of time-series physiological signals (ECG, blood
      pressure, respiration) along with annotations to learn complex temporal patterns
      for automated diagnosis, risk stratification, and patient monitoring. The format's
      widespread adoption in datasets like PhysioNet enables reproducible AI research,
      benchmark comparisons, and transfer learning across different cardiac monitoring
      applications. AI systems use WFDB for real-time signal processing in ICU monitoring,
      wearable cardiac devices, and telemedicine platforms.

  description: Minimal Information Required In the Annotation of Models
  is_open: true
  name: MIRIAM
  purpose_detail: MIRIAM (Minimum Information Required In the Annotation of biochemical
    Models) is a set of guidelines and standards developed by the computational systems
    biology community to ensure consistent annotation and curation of computational
    models in biology, particularly those encoded in SBML (Systems Biology Markup
    Language) and CellML formats. MIRIAM defines requirements for model attribution
    including reference publications, creator information, creation dates, and modification
    history to ensure proper provenance tracking and reproducibility. The guidelines
    mandate the use of controlled vocabularies and standardized identifiers from MIRIAM
    Resources (identifiers.org) to annotate biological entities such as genes, proteins,
    metabolites, reactions, and pathways with unambiguous references to external databases
    like UniProt, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome. MIRIAM specifies the use
    of RDF (Resource Description Framework) and qualified annotations to encode biological
    semantics and relationships between model components and biological knowledge.
    The standard promotes model reusability by requiring clear licensing information
    (Creative Commons, etc.), encoded parameter units using standardized ontologies,
    and comprehensive documentation of model assumptions and limitations. MIRIAM compliance
    is supported by tools including the MIRIAM annotation editor in systems biology
    software, libSBML annotation functions, and BioModels Database validation workflows.
    The guidelines have been widely adopted by model repositories (BioModels, CellML
    Model Repository), enhancing model discoverability, integration into larger modeling
    frameworks, and facilitating quantitative comparison of alternative models representing
    the same biological system.

  purpose_detail: The Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) is a unified
    standard developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) for describing sequence
    data from diverse environments and organisms. MIxS provides a single point of
    entry for the scientific community to access and use GSC checklists, which include
    11 distinct sequence types covering bacterial/archaeal genomes (MigsBa), eukaryotes
    (MigsEu), organelles (MigsOrg), plasmids (MigsPl), viruses (MigsVi), marker sequences
    (MimarksC/S), metagenomes (Mims), metagenome-assembled genomes (Mimag), single
    amplified genomes (Misag), and uncultivated virus genomes (Miuvig). The standard
    is complemented by 21 environmental extensions tailored to specific sampling contexts
    including agriculture, air, built environment, food production, host-associated,
    human-associated (with specific gut, oral, skin, and vaginal extensions), hydrocarbon
    resources, microbial mat/biofilm, plant-associated, sediment, soil, symbiont-associated,
    wastewater/sludge, and water environments. The specification is maintained as
    a YAML-formatted LinkML schema serving as the authoritative source for generating
    downstream GSC artifacts.

    that the existence of two separate formats for essentially the same thing generated
    confusion and required extra programming effort. Therefore the PSI, with full
    participation by ISB, has developed a new format by taking the best aspects of
    each of the precursor formats to form a single one. It is intended to replace
    the previous two formats. This new format was originally given a working name
    of dataXML. The final name is mzML.

    by mass spectrometry. A large number of different software packages are available
    that produce output in a variety of different formats. It is intended that mzQuantML
    will provide a common format for the export of identification results from any
    software package. The format was originally developed under the name AnalysisXML
    as a format for several types of computational analyses performed over mass spectra
    in the proteomics context. It has been decided to split development into two formats,
    mzIdentML for peptide and protein identification and mzQuantML (described here),
    covering quantitative proteomic data derived from MS. The development of mzQuantML
    is driven by some general principles, specific use cases and the goal of supporting
    specific techniques, as listed below. These were discussed and agreed at the development
    meeting in Tubingen in July 2011.

  description: mzXML format
  is_open: true
  name: mzXML
  publication: doi:10.1038/nbt1031
  purpose_detail: mzXML was a pioneering open, generic XML (extensible markup language)
    representation specifically developed for mass spectrometry (MS) data exchange
    and storage in proteomics research. As one of the first standardized formats for
    MS data, mzXML provided a vendor-neutral way to represent complex mass spectrometry
    information including mass-to-charge ratios, intensity values, scan parameters,
    and instrument metadata in a structured, machine-readable format. The format supported
    both profile and centroid data representation modes and could accommodate various
    types of MS experiments including MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Despite its historical
    significance in establishing data standardization practices in proteomics, mzXML
    is now deprecated and has been superseded by the more comprehensive mzML format,
    which offers enhanced features, better compression, controlled vocabularies, and
    broader community support. While legacy systems may still encounter mzXML files,
    current best practices recommend migration to mzML for new data processing workflows
    and long-term data preservation in mass spectrometry applications.

    routine and rapid execution of distributed complex analytics. To meet this design
    requirement, some fields are duplicated across multiple tables to support faster
    analytic operations for distributed querying. The PCORnet CDM is based on the
    FDA Mini-Sentinel CDM. This allows PCORnet to more easily leverage the large array
    of analytic tools and expertise developed for the MSCDM v4.0, including data characterization
    approaches and the various tools for complex distributed analytics.

  purpose_detail: Natural Collections Description (NCD) (A data standard for exchanging
    data describing natural history collections) is a proposed data standard for describing
    collections of natural history materials at the collection level; one NCD record
    describes one entire collection. Collection descriptions are electronic records
    that document the holdings of an organisation as groups of items, which complement
    the more traditional item-level records such as are produced for a single specimen
    or a library book. NCD is tailored to natural history. It lies between general
    resource discovery standards such as Dublin Core (DC) and rich collection description
    standards such as the Encoded Archival Description (EAD). The NCD standard covers
    all types of natural history collections, such as specimens, original artwork,
    archives, observations, library materials, datasets, photographs or mixed collections
    such as those that result from expeditions and voyages of discovery.

  purpose_detail: The NCPDP Formulary and Benefit Standard provides a standardized
    means for pharmacy benefit payers, including health plans and Pharmacy Benefit
    Managers (PBMs), to electronically communicate formulary and benefit information
    to prescribers via technology vendor systems. This standard enables real-time
    access to critical medication coverage information at the point of prescribing,
    including patient eligibility verification, product coverage status, benefit financial
    details (copayments, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs), coverage restrictions
    such as prior authorization requirements, step therapy protocols, quantity limits,
    and therapeutic alternatives when restrictions exist. By standardizing this data
    exchange, the standard reduces prescription abandonment, improves medication adherence,
    decreases prior authorization processing time, and enhances clinical decision-making
    by providing prescribers with transparent, actionable benefit information. The
    standard supports integration with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems and
    e-prescribing platforms in accordance with HIPAA, MMA, HITECH, and Meaningful
    Use requirements, ultimately contributing to reduced healthcare costs and improved
    patient safety through more informed prescribing decisions.

  publication: doi:10.1101/523035
  purpose_detail: Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) is a comprehensive data standard
    and software ecosystem for neurophysiology and behavioral data, developed by a
    collaborative team of neuroscientists and software developers to break down barriers
    to data sharing in neuroscience. NWB supports diverse neurophysiology data types
    including intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology (single-unit recordings,
    local field potentials, patch-clamp), optical physiology (calcium imaging, two-photon
    microscopy, optogenetics), behavioral tracking, stimulus presentation metadata,
    and experimental trial structures. The format is built on HDF5, providing efficient
    storage and access to large-scale datasets while maintaining human-readable metadata.
    NWB's extensibility mechanism through neurodata extensions allows researchers
    to adapt the standard for novel recording modalities and experimental paradigms
    without breaking compatibility. The ecosystem includes PyNWB and MatNWB APIs for
    data creation and access, validation tools, and integration with the DANDI Archive
    for public data sharing. NWB adoption is growing across major neuroscience initiatives
    with support from Allen Institute, HHMI, Kavli Foundation, Simons Foundation,
    and INCF, facilitating reproducible research, cross-laboratory data integration,
    and development of standardized analysis pipelines across cellular, systems, and
    computational neuroscience.

  description: Nibble sequence format
  is_open: true
  name: nib
  purpose_detail: The nibble (.nib) format is a compact binary file format for storing
    DNA sequences, originally developed for the UCSC Genome Browser and BLAT alignment
    tool. The format achieves 4-fold compression by packing two nucleotide bases per
    byte using 2-bit encoding (A=00, C=01, G=10, T=11), significantly reducing storage
    requirements compared to text-based FASTA format. Each .nib file contains a single
    sequence record with a simple header specifying sequence length and format version,
    followed by the packed sequence data. The format stores sequences in a form optimized
    for rapid access by genome browsers and alignment algorithms, supporting efficient
    memory mapping for large-scale genomic analyses. While .nib files provide space-efficient
    storage, they lack the flexibility of indexed formats like 2bit (which can store
    multiple sequences) and have been largely superseded by more modern compressed
    formats. The format remains in use for legacy applications and continues to be
    supported by UCSC Genome Browser utilities including nibFrag for sequence extraction
    and faToNib/nibToFa for format conversion, primarily for maintaining compatibility
    with older genome browser implementations and analysis pipelines.

    description: OMOP Common Evidence Model is used in AI applications for standardizing
      the representation of evidence from observational studies, enabling machine
      learning models to learn causal relationships from real-world data and generate
      reliable evidence for treatment effectiveness. AI systems leverage CEM's structured
      representation of study designs, populations, exposures, and outcomes to train
      models that estimate treatment effects from observational data, adjust for confounding
      using propensity score methods, and validate predictions through negative controls.
      The model enables AI applications in comparative effectiveness research, pharmacovigilance,
      and evidence synthesis where distinguishing correlation from causation is critical.
      Machine learning approaches use CEM to automate evidence quality assessment
      and synthesize findings across heterogeneous observational studies.

  is_open: true
  name: AOM14
  purpose_detail: This document contains the definitive statement of archetype semantics,
    in the form of an object model for archetypes. The AOM provides a comprehensive
    formal specification enabling software to process archetypes independent of their
    persistent representation (ADL, XML, or other formats). The model defines constraint-based
    domain entities through hierarchical structures alternating between object and
    attribute constraints (C_COMPLEX_OBJECT, C_ATTRIBUTE, C_PRIMITIVE_OBJECT classes).
    It supports archetype specialization with explicit depth tracking, composition
    through archetype slots with assertion-based constraints, and domain-specific
    extensions via C_DOMAIN_TYPE classes. The AOM includes comprehensive primitive
    type constraints (C_DATE, C_TIME, C_STRING, C_INTEGER), reference mechanisms (ARCHETYPE_INTERNAL_REF,
    CONSTRAINT_REF), and assertion capabilities using first-order predicate logic.
    It provides the semantic foundation for archetype-enabled kernels, ADL parsers,
    and archetype validation systems in clinical information modeling, enabling programmatic
    manipulation of constraint structures and serving as the API specification for
    archetype-based software applications.

      reusable clinical information models that enable semantic interoperability of
      health data across systems and support consistent feature extraction for machine
      learning. AI systems leverage archetypes to understand the clinical meaning
      and constraints of health data elements, enabling models to learn from data
      collected using openEHR archetypes across different implementations. The standardized
      clinical models support AI applications that require portable feature definitions,
      enable transfer learning across healthcare systems using archetypes, and ensure
      that AI models interpret clinical concepts consistently regardless of underlying
      database structures. Archetypes provide machine-readable clinical semantics
      that improve AI model interpretability and facilitate automated validation of
      model inputs.

  purpose_detail: The quality of research in hospital epidemiology (infection control)
    must be improved to be robust enough to influence policy and practice. In order
    to raise the standards of research and publication, a CONSORT equivalent for these
    largely quasi-experimental studies has been prepared by the authors of two relevant
    systematic reviews undertaken for the HTA and the Cochrane Collaboration. The
    statement was revised following widespread consultation with learned societies,
    editors of journals and researchers. It consists of a 22 item checklist, and a
    summary table. The emphasis is on transparency to improve the quality of reporting
    and on the use of appropriate statistical techniques.The statement has been endorsed
    and welcomed by a number of professional special interest groups and societies
    including the Association of Medical Microbiologists (AMM), Bristish Society for
    Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and the Infection Control Nurses' Association
    (ICNA) Research and Development Group. Like CONSORT, ORION considers itself a
    work in progress, which requires ongoing dialogue for successful promotion and
    dissemination. The statement is therefore offered for further public discussion
    and journals are encouraged to trial it as part of their reviewing and editing
    process and feedback to the authors.

  description: Physical Activity Monitoring for Fitness Wearables Step Counting
  is_open: true
  name: ANSI/CTA-2056
  purpose_detail: ANSI/CTA-2056 is a voluntary consensus standard developed by the
    Consumer Technology Association (CTA) that establishes standardized definitions,
    testing methodologies, and minimum performance criteria for measuring step counting
    accuracy on consumer wearable devices and smartphone applications used for physical
    activity monitoring and health tracking. The standard defines a "step" as a single
    stride during human locomotion and specifies validation protocols using controlled
    laboratory testing on treadmills at various speeds (slow walking 2.0 mph, normal
    walking 3.0 mph, brisk walking 4.0 mph) as well as free-living wear tests in real-world
    conditions to evaluate device performance across diverse user populations and
    activity patterns. ANSI/CTA-2056 requires manufacturers to report step counting
    accuracy as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and specifies acceptable error
    thresholds - devices should achieve less than 10% error for controlled walking
    tests and less than 20% error for free-living conditions to meet the standard's
    performance benchmarks. The standard addresses measurement challenges including
    false positive step detection from upper body movements, vehicle vibrations, and
    daily living activities, as well as false negative errors from slow shuffling
    gaits or irregular walking patterns. ANSI/CTA-2056 promotes transparency by requiring
    clear disclosure of test conditions, participant demographics, reference measurement
    systems (ActiGraph accelerometers, manual observation), and statistical analysis
    methods used for validation. The standard facilitates comparability across commercial
    fitness trackers, smartwatches, and pedometer applications from manufacturers
    like Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, and Samsung, supporting consumer informed decision-making,
    clinical research applications requiring validated activity metrics, and workplace
    wellness programs utilizing step count goals for employee health initiatives.

    of other types of research, particularly evaluations of interventions. PRISMA
    may also be useful for critical appraisal of published systematic reviews, although
    it is not a quality assessment instrument to gauge the quality of a systematic

    information on all PSI activities, please see PSI Home Page. The PSI-PAR format
    is a standardized means of representing protein affinity reagent data and is designed
    to facilitate the exchange of information between different databases and/or LIMS
    systems. PSI-PAR is not a proposed database structure. The PSI-PAR format consists
    of the PSI-MI XML2.5 schema (originally designed for molecular interactions) and
    the PSI-PAR controlled vocabulary. In addition, PSI-PAR documentation and examples
    are available on this web page. The scope of PSI-PAR is PAR and target protein
    production and characterization.

  description: qcML format

  name: qcML
  publication: doi:10.1074/mcp.M113.035907
  purpose_detail: An XML format for quality-related data of mass spectrometry and
    other high-throughput experiments. Quality control is increasingly recognized
    as a crucial aspect of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Several recent papers
    discuss relevant parameters for quality control and present applications to extract
    these from the instrumental raw data. What has been missing, however, is a standard
    data exchange format for reporting these performance metrics. We therefore developed
    the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the
    related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics
    Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for
    the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format
    and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational
    storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe
    the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example
    of the subsequent analysis possibilities. All information about qcML is available
    at http://code.google.com/p/qcml

  description: Real-time PCR Data Markup Language
  is_open: true
  name: RDML
  purpose_detail: The RDML file format is developed by the RDML consortium (http://www.rdml.org)
    and can be used free of charge. The RDML file format was created to encourage
    the exchange, publication, revision and re-analysis of raw qPCR data. The core
    of an RDML file is an experiment, not a PCR run. Therefore all the information
    is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the
    file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master
    elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure
    allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to
    provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a
    structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR)
    data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the
    experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard
    is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent
    exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data
    analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors,
    peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this
    standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well
    as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import
    and export of RDML data files.

  purpose_detail: REFLECT (Reporting guidElines For randomized controLled trials for
    livEstoCk and food safeTy) is a specialized, evidence-based minimum set of 22
    reporting items specifically designed to improve the transparency, reproducibility,
    and quality of randomized controlled trials in livestock production, animal health,
    and food safety research. This comprehensive reporting guideline addresses the
    unique challenges and complexities inherent in agricultural and veterinary research,
    including both field trials conducted in real-world farm settings and controlled
    challenge studies in laboratory environments. REFLECT covers essential aspects
    of trial design, implementation, and reporting including study population characteristics,
    randomization procedures, intervention details, outcome measurements, statistical
    analyses, and results presentation. The guideline is specifically tailored for
    trials evaluating therapeutic or preventive interventions that impact production
    outcomes, animal health parameters, and food safety measures. Available in both
    MS Word and PDF formats, REFLECT serves as a dynamic, evolving document that is
    periodically updated as new evidence emerges, helping researchers, editors, reviewers,
    and regulatory agencies ensure that livestock and food safety trials are reported
    with sufficient detail for proper scientific evaluation and evidence-based decision
    making.

  description: Reporting recommendations for tumour Marker prognostic studies
  formal_specification: https://www.equator-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REMARK-checklist-for-EQUATOR-website-002.docx
  is_open: true
  name: REMARK
  publication: doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6602678
  purpose_detail: Despite years of research and hundreds of reports on tumor markers
    in oncology, the number of markers that have emerged as clinically useful is pitifully
    small. Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent
    studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand
    in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt
    to understand the reasons why multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing
    conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these
    discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported
    in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information
    to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability
    of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker
    studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation
    for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on
    Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized
    trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines
    to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses,
    patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis
    methods. In addition, the guidelines provide helpful suggestions on how to present
    data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines
    is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information
    will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and
    understand the context in which the conclusions apply.

  name: SAM
  publication: doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp352
  purpose_detail: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a TAB-delimited text
    format for storing sequence alignments against reference sequences, developed
    as part of the samtools project and maintained by the GA4GH Large Scale Genomics
    work stream. SAM consists of an optional header section (beginning with @ symbols)
    containing metadata about reference sequences, read groups, programs, and comments,
    followed by an alignment section with one line per aligned read. Each alignment
    line contains 11 mandatory fields including query name (QNAME), bitwise FLAG encoding
    mapping properties, reference sequence name (RNAME), 1-based leftmost mapping
    position (POS), mapping quality (MAPQ), CIGAR string describing alignment operations,
    mate pair information (RNEXT, PNEXT, TLEN), sequence (SEQ), and ASCII-encoded
    base quality scores (QUAL). The format supports optional fields as TAG:TYPE:VALUE
    triplets for storing additional information such as edit distance, alternative
    alignments, and aligner-specific metadata. SAM serves as the text-based companion
    to the binary BAM and compressed CRAM formats, with bidirectional conversion tools
    (samtools view) enabling interoperability. The format accommodates various alignment
    types including mapped, unmapped, secondary, supplementary, and chimeric alignments
    with proper-pair relationships. SAM files are human-readable for debugging and
    inspection, widely supported by aligners (BWA, Bowtie2, STAR), variant callers,
    and genomics toolkits, forming the foundation for standardized sequencing data
    exchange in next-generation sequencing workflows.

  name: SOFT
  purpose_detail: Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT) is a line-based, plain text
    format originally developed by NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for batch submission
    and download of genomic data. Though GEO discontinued accepting SOFT submissions
    in early 2024, all records remain available for download in SOFT format. The format
    uses four line types distinguished by first-character markers - caret lines (^)
    indicate entity types (PLATFORM, SAMPLE, SERIES), bang lines (!) specify entity
    attributes as label-value pairs, hash lines (#) describe data table headers, and
    data lines contain tab-delimited table rows. A single SOFT file can concatenate
    multiple Platform (GPL), Sample (GSM), and Series (GSE) records with their data
    tables and descriptive metadata. Platform tables require unique row identifiers
    and trackable sequence identifiers (GenBank/RefSeq accessions, clone IDs, oligo
    sequences) with standard headers for sequences, organism source, and various accession
    types. Sample tables must include ID_REF columns matching Platform identifiers
    and VALUE columns containing normalized, comparable measurements (scaled signals
    for single-channel or log ratios for dual-channel data). The format is compatible
    with common spreadsheet and database applications and supports MIAME standards
    for comprehensive data interpretation.

      applications for creating precise, unambiguous representations of genetic variants

      to normalize variant representations from diverse sources (clinical labs, research
      databases, literature), enabling consistent feature engineering for machine
      learning models predicting variant pathogenicity. The notation resolves ambiguities
      in variant left-normalization and reference sequence specification that can
      cause the same biological variant to appear as different features to AI models,
      improving model accuracy and reproducibility. SPDI is particularly valuable
      for clinical AI systems that must reconcile variants reported in different formats
      across laboratories.

    system developed by the ISBER Biospecimen Science Working Group to standardize
    documentation of pre-analytical variables that affect biospecimen quality. SPREC
    uses a seven-element alphanumeric code to capture critical factors including specimen
    type, primary container, time to processing (warm and cold ischemia), centrifugation
    parameters (speed and temperature), and long-term storage conditions. This systematic
    encoding enables biobanks and biorepositories to consistently track and communicate
    how specimens were collected, processed, and preserved, which directly impacts
    molecular analyte stability and experimental reproducibility. By providing a standardized
    language for pre-analytical variation, SPREC facilitates data harmonization across
    biobanks, enables quality comparisons between specimen collections, supports regulatory
    compliance, and enhances the value of biological samples for translational research.
    The code is particularly valuable for multi-center studies where specimen provenance
    must be tracked and controlled. SPREC version 3.0 covers various specimen types
    including blood, tissue, urine, and other biological fluids, with specific codes
    for derivatives like DNA, RNA, and proteins.

  description: Strengthening the Reporting of Genetic Association studies
  is_open: true
  name: STREGA
  publication: doi:10.1002/gepi.20410
  purpose_detail: Making sense of rapidly evolving evidence on genetic associations
    is crucial to making genuine advances in human genomics and the eventual integration
    of this information in the practice of medicine and public health. Assessment
    of the strengths and weaknesses of this evidence, and hence the ability to synthesize
    it, has been limited by inadequate reporting of results. The STrengthening the
    REporting of Genetic Association studies (STREGA) initiative builds on the Strengthening
    the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement and
    provides additions to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The additions
    concern population stratification, genotyping errors, modelling haplotype variation,
    Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, replication, selection of participants, rationale
    for choice of genes and variants, treatment effects in studying quantitative traits,
    statistical methods, relatedness, reporting of descriptive and outcome data, and
    the volume of data issues that are important to consider in genetic association
    studies. The STREGA recommendations do not prescribe or dictate how a genetic
    association study should be designed but seek to enhance the transparency of its
    reporting, regardless of choices made during design, conduct, or analysis.

  publication: doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2007.11.008
  purpose_detail: STROBE stands for an international, collaborative initiative of
    epidemiologists, methodologists, statisticians, researchers and journal editors
    involved in the conduct and dissemination of observational studies, with the common
    aim of STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology. The
    STROBE Statement is being endorsed by a growing number of biomedical journals.
    Incomplete and inadequate reporting of research hampers the assessment of the
    strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the medical literature. Readers
    need to know what was planned (and what was not), what was done, what was found,
    and what the results mean. Recommendations on the reporting of studies that are
    endorsed by leading medical journals can improve the quality of reporting.Observational
    research comprises several study designs and many topic areas. We aimed to establish
    a checklist of items that should be included in articles reporting such research
    - the STROBE Statement. We considered it reasonable to initially restrict the
    recommendations to the three main analytical designs that are used in observational
    research - cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We want to provide
    guidance on how to report observational research well. Our recommendations are
    not prescriptions for designing or conducting studies. Also, the checklist is
    not an instrument to evaluate the quality of observational research.

  is_open: true
  name: SBGN
  publication: doi:10.1038/nbt.1558
  purpose_detail: Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) is a standardized visual
    language for representing biological processes and relationships in maps. SBGN
    defines the precise meaning of all graphical symbols through three complementary
    languages - Process Description (PD) for biochemical reactions and molecular interactions,
    Activity Flow (AF) for the flow of information between biochemical entities, and
    Entity Relationship (ER) for relationships between biological entities independent
    of temporal aspects. Each language has specific symbols, syntax rules, and semantic
    definitions to ensure unambiguous interpretation across different tools and users.
    SBGN-ML, an XML-based exchange format, enables storage and transfer of SBGN diagrams
    between software applications, supported by the standard LibSBGN library. The
    notation is widely adopted in major biological databases including Reactome, PANTHER
    Pathway, BioModels, and Pathway Commons. Multiple software tools support SBGN
    diagram creation and editing (CellDesigner, Newt Editor, VANTED/SBGN-ED, PathVisio,
    yEd), format conversion from KEGG, BioPAX, and SBML, and visualization of pathway
    models, facilitating standardized communication of complex biological knowledge
    across the systems biology community.

  name: SBML
  publication: doi:10.1515/jib-2017-0081
  purpose_detail: The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a comprehensive XML-based
    exchange format specifically designed for representing computational models of
    biological processes in a machine-readable, standardized form. Developed and maintained
    by the international SBML community, SBML enables interoperability between diverse
    systems biology software tools by providing a common model representation language
    that eliminates translation errors and ensures consistent model interpretation
    across different platforms. While SBML excels at representing biochemical reaction
    networks, metabolic pathways, gene regulatory networks, and signal transduction
    cascades, its flexible architecture supports modeling of various biological phenomena
    from molecular to cellular scales. The format includes sophisticated features
    for describing reaction kinetics, species concentrations, compartmentalization,
    parameter sensitivity, and dynamic behaviors through mathematical expressions
    and differential equations. SBML's modular design supports extensions for specialized
    modeling requirements including spatial modeling, flux balance analysis, and multi-scale
    simulations. Supported by over 270 software tools, SBML serves as the de facto
    standard for systems biology model exchange, enabling reproducible research, model
    sharing, database integration, and collaborative development in computational
    systems biology.

  description: Systems Biology Results Markup Language
  is_open: false
  name: SBRML
  purpose_detail: Systems Biology has benefited tremendously from the development
    and use of SBML, which is a markup language to specify models composed of molecular
    species, and their interactions (including reactions). SBML is a common format
    that many systems biology software understand and thus it has become the way in
    which models are shared and communicated. Despite the popularity of SBML, that
    has resulted in many models being available in electronic format, there is currently
    no standard way of communicating the results of the operations carried out with
    such models (e.g. simulations). Here we propose a new markup language which is
    complementary to SBML and which is intended to specify results from operations
    carried out on models SBRML. In fact, this markup language is useful also to communicate
    experimental data as long as it is possible to express the data in terms of a
    reference SBML model. Thus SBRML is a means of specifying quantitative results
    in the context of a systems biology model.

  name: TCS
  purpose_detail: The development of an abstract model for a taxonomic concept, which
    can capture the various models represented and understood by the various data
    providers, is central to this project. This model is presented as an XML schema
    document that is proposed as a standard to allow exchange of data between different
    data models. It aims to capture data as understood by the data owners without
    distortion, and facilitate the query of different data resources according to
    the common schema model. The TCS schema was conceived to allow the representation
    of taxonomic concepts as defined in published taxonomic classifications, revisions
    and databases. As such, it specifies the structure for XML documents to be used
    for the transfer of defined concepts. Valid transfer documents may either explicitly
    detail the defining components of taxon concepts, transfer GUIDs referring to
    defined taxon concepts (if and when these are available) or a mixture of the two.

    description: TCS (Taxonomic Concept Schema) is used in AI applications for managing
      taxonomic concepts and classifications, enabling machine learning models to
      understand species relationships, resolve taxonomic synonyms, and integrate
      biodiversity data across different classification systems. AI systems leverage
      TCS to train models that automatically map species names across taxonomies,
      predict taxonomic placement of newly discovered organisms, and reconcile conflicting
      classifications. The schema supports natural language processing applications
      that extract taxonomic information from scientific literature, automated quality
      control of species occurrence records, and machine learning approaches to phylogenetic
      inference. TCS enables AI systems to reason about taxonomic hierarchies and
      evolutionary relationships when analyzing biological data.

  is_open: true
  name: UNII
  purpose_detail: Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNIIs) are alphanumeric codes generated
    by the FDA's Global Substance Registration System (GSRS) to uniquely identify
    substances based on their scientific identity characteristics using ISO 11238
    data elements. Each UNII is derived from a substance's molecular structure and/or
    descriptive information, ensuring that the same substance always receives the
    same identifier regardless of when or where it is registered in the regulatory
    lifecycle. UNIIs enable efficient and accurate exchange of substance information
    across regulatory submissions, product labeling, adverse event reporting, and
    drug databases without ambiguity from varying nomenclature or trade names. The
    system covers diverse substance types including chemical compounds, proteins,
    nucleic acids, polymers, mixtures, structurally diverse materials, and specified
    substances (salts, stereoisomers, defined mixtures). UNIIs are generated at any
    time in the regulatory process and do not imply FDA review or approval. The GSRS
    database provides searchable access to UNIIs along with associated substance names,
    codes (CAS, INN, EC), structural representations, and attribute data. UNIIs are
    extensively used in SPL (Structured Product Labeling) documents, NDC (National
    Drug Code) directory, FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System), and international
    regulatory systems, facilitating interoperability between FDA databases and harmonization
    with global substance identification standards.

  publication: doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2021.100027
  purpose_detail: The Variation Representation Specification (VRS, pronounced “verse”)
    is a standard developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)
    to facilitate and improve sharing of genetic information. The Specification consists
    of a JSON Schema for representing many classes of genetic variation, conventions
    to maximize the utility of the schema, and a Python implementation that promotes
    adoption of the standard.

    name: Standardized Variant Representation for ML Interoperability
    description: VRS (Variation Representation Specification) is used in AI applications
      to create unambiguous, computationally accessible representations of genetic
      variants that enable machine learning model interoperability across different
      genomic databases and variant calling pipelines. AI systems leverage VRS to
      normalize variant representations, resolve ambiguities in variant nomenclature,
      and create consistent feature representations for training models that predict
      variant effects, interpret clinical significance, or perform variant prioritization.
      VRS's precise coordinate system and allele representation enable AI models to
      correctly match variants across different genome builds, integrate data from
      multiple sources, and generate reproducible predictions that can be shared across
      institutions and validated against standardized variant benchmarks.

  description: VarioML format
  formal_specification: https://github.com/VarioML/VarioML
  is_open: true
  name: VarioML
  purpose_detail: A Locus-specific Database (LSDB) describes the variants discovered
    on a single gene or members of a gene family and other related functional elements.
    LSDBs are curated by experts on their respective loci, and as such are typically
    the best resources of such information available. But LSDBs vary widely in format
    and completeness, making data integration and exchange among them difficult and
    time-consuming. To address these difficulties, the VarioML format has been developed
    for the full range of variation data use-cases, providing semantically well-defined
    components which can be easily composed to fit specific needs. Using VarioML,
    data owners can now efficiently enable the integration, federation, and exchange
    of their variant data. The discoverabiliaty, extensibility, and quality of variation
    data is immediately enhanced. Critical new avenues of research and knowledge discovery
    are opened, as data using the VarioML standard can be integrated with the global
    library of purely genetic data. VarioML is a central prerequisite for effective
    modelling of phenotype data and genotype-to-phenotype relationships. It removes
    the long-standing technical obstacles to the effective passing of variant data
    from discovery laboratories into the biomedical database world. Now all that is
    needed is the broad participation of the genotype-to-phenotype research community.

  description: Vocabulary Maintenance Standard
  has_relevant_organization:
  - B2AI_ORG:93
  is_open: true
  name: VMS
  purpose_detail: The Vocabulary Maintenance Standard (VMS) is a TDWG (Biodiversity
    Information Standards) specification that defines formal procedures for maintaining
    and evolving controlled vocabularies used in biodiversity informatics. Unlike
    traditional standards that remain relatively static, VMS recognizes that vocabulary
    standards must adapt incrementally to meet evolving community needs without requiring
    the full standards ratification process for every change. The specification categorizes
    types of vocabulary modifications (additions, modifications, deprecations) and
    establishes governance mechanisms for implementing these changes through designated
    vocabulary maintenance groups. VMS defines roles and responsibilities for stakeholders
    including vocabulary maintainers, Interest Groups, and the broader TDWG community,
    specifying how change proposals are submitted, reviewed, and approved. The standard
    ensures that vocabulary evolution remains transparent, traceable, and backward-compatible
    where possible, while maintaining the stability needed for production systems.
    VMS applies to major TDWG vocabularies including Darwin Core terms and is essential
    for maintaining semantic interoperability across biodiversity data systems as
    scientific understanding and data practices evolve.

  purpose_detail: A statistically robust Voice Handicap Index (VHI). An 85-item version
    of this instrument was administered to 65 consecutive patients seen in the Voice
    Clinic at Henry Ford Hospital. The data were subjected to measures of internal
    consistency reliability and the initial 85-item version was reduced to a 30-item
    final version. This final version was administered to 63 consecutive patients
    on two occasions in an attempt to assess test-retest stability, which proved to
    be strong. The findings of the latter analysis demonstrated that a change between
    two administrations of 18 points represents a significant shift in psychosocial
    function.

  publication: doi:10.1007/s11517-013-1097-7
  purpose_detail: FieldML is a declarative language for building hierarchical models
    represented by generalized mathematical fields. FieldML is developed as a data
    model and accompanying API. Find out more about the FieldML API, where to get
    the latest release and how to contribute to its development. FieldML is a declarative
    language for representing hierarchical models using generalized mathematical fields.
    FieldML can be used to represent the dynamic 3D geometry and solution fields from
    computational models of cells, tissues and organs. It enables model interchange
    for the bioengineering and general engineering analysis communities. Example uses
    are models of tissue structure, the distribution of proteins and other biochemical
    compounds, anatomical annotation, and other biological annotation.

    description: JPEG format is used in AI applications for efficient storage and
      transmission of medical images, particularly in telepathology, dermatology AI,
      and mobile diagnostic applications where bandwidth and storage constraints are
      critical. Deep learning models are trained on JPEG-compressed whole slide images,
      dermoscopic images, and fundus photographs to perform tasks such as cancer detection,
      skin lesion classification, and diabetic retinopathy screening. While DICOM
      remains the standard for radiology, JPEG enables AI deployment in resource-constrained
      settings and supports transfer learning from natural image datasets (ImageNet)
      to medical imaging domains. AI researchers must account for JPEG compression
      artifacts when training models, and recent work explores AI-optimized compression
      techniques that preserve diagnostically relevant features.

    description: NNEF (Neural Network Exchange Format) is used in biomedical AI for
      deploying models on medical devices and embedded systems where hardware-specific
      optimization and standardized model representation are critical. Medical device
      manufacturers leverage NNEF to ensure neural network models can be optimized
      for diverse hardware accelerators (DSPs, NPUs, custom ASICs) commonly used in
      portable medical equipment, bedside monitors, and point-of-care devices. The
      format enables vendor-independent model deployment, facilitates regulatory approval
      by providing clear model specifications, and supports hardware efficiency optimizations
      necessary for real-time inference in resource-constrained medical devices. NNEF
      is particularly valuable for AI-enabled medical devices where power consumption,
      latency, and deterministic behavior are critical requirements.

    This encoding is an essential dependency for the OGC Sensor Observation Service
    (SOS) Interface Standard. More specifically, this standard defines XML schemas
    for observations, and for features involved in sampling when making observations.
    These provide document models for the exchange of information describing observation
    acts and their results, both within and between different scientific and technical
    communities.

    description: ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is used in biomedical AI for
      creating framework-agnostic models that can be trained in PyTorch, TensorFlow,
      or other frameworks and deployed across diverse clinical platforms and hardware
      accelerators. Healthcare AI developers leverage ONNX to ensure vendor independence,
      enabling models to run on different hospital IT systems, edge devices, and specialized
      medical hardware regardless of training framework. The standard facilitates
      regulatory submissions by providing a stable model representation, supports
      hardware optimization through ONNX Runtime's performance tuning for CPUs, GPUs,
      and custom accelerators, and enables model sharing across research institutions
      without requiring framework dependencies. ONNX is particularly valuable for
      clinical AI products that must support multiple deployment environments.

    description: Apache Parquet is widely adopted in AI/ML pipelines for efficient
      storage and processing of large-scale biomedical datasets, particularly for
      training deep learning models on tabular clinical data, multi-omics datasets,
      and imaging metadata. The columnar storage format enables high-performance data
      loading during model training, reduces storage costs through efficient compression,
      and supports predicate pushdown for selective feature reading. AI frameworks
      like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn leverage Parquet's integration with
      Apache Arrow for zero-copy data transfer, enabling faster iteration during hyperparameter
      tuning and model development. Parquet is particularly valuable for storing processed
      features from EHR data, genomic variant annotations, and large-scale biobank
      datasets where query performance and storage efficiency are critical.

  description: RDF Schema
  has_relevant_organization:

  is_open: true
  name: RDFS
  purpose_detail: RDF Schema (RDFS) is the foundational vocabulary description language
    that extends the basic RDF vocabulary to provide essential data modeling capabilities
    for the Semantic Web and linked data applications. As a W3C Recommendation and
    semantic extension of RDF, RDFS enables the description of groups of related resources
    and relationships between them by defining classes, properties, and their hierarchical
    structures. Unlike traditional object-oriented programming models that define
    classes in terms of their instance properties, RDFS takes a property-centric approach
    where properties are described in terms of the classes they apply to through domain
    and range mechanisms. This design philosophy promotes the extensibility principle
    of the Web, allowing anyone to define additional properties for existing resources
    without requiring modification of original class definitions. RDFS provides core
    vocabulary elements including rdfs:Class, rdfs:Resource, rdfs:Property, rdfs:subClassOf,
    rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:domain, rdfs:range, rdfs:label, and rdfs:comment, which
    form the basis for more sophisticated ontology languages like OWL. The schema
    supports the development of machine-readable vocabularies that can be processed
    automatically, enabling applications to discover and reason about resource relationships,
    making it an essential component of the Semantic Web infrastructure.

    is an XML-based metadata schema developed by the Australian National Data Service
    (ANDS) for describing and exchanging information about research collections, services,
    parties (people and organizations), and activities. RIF-CS serves as the foundational
    data interchange format for Research Data Australia and enables institutions to
    contribute metadata about their research assets to national and international
    discovery services. The schema organizes metadata into four core entity types
    with rich relationship modeling capabilities - collections (datasets, databases,
    repositories), services (software tools, web services, facilities), parties (researchers,
    institutions, funders), and activities (projects, programs, events). Each entity
    supports comprehensive descriptive metadata including identifiers, names, descriptions,
    locations, dates, subjects, and crucially, relationships to other entities that
    create a connected graph of research infrastructure. RIF-CS enables automated
    harvesting and aggregation of research metadata across institutions, supporting
    research discovery, collaboration, and compliance with research data management
    policies.

  purpose_detail: The goal of the Structured Descriptive Data (SDD) standard is to
    allow capture, transport, caching and archiving of descriptive data in all the
    forms shown above, using a platform- and application-independent, international
    standard. Such a standard is crucial to enabling lossless porting of data between
    existing and future software platforms including identification, data-mining and
    analysis tools, and federated databases.

    UNIX-based utility used to package files together for backup or distribution purposes.
    It contains multiple files (also known as a tarball) stored in an uncompressed
    format along with metadata about the archive. Tar files are not compressed archive
    files. They are often compressed with file compression utilities such as gzip
    or bzip2.

  purpose_detail: The TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval (TAPIR) is a
    Web Service protocol and XML schema to perform queries across distributed databases
    of varied physical and logical structure. It was originally designed to be used
    by federated networks. TAPIR is intended for communication between applications,
    using HTTP as the transport mechanism. TAPIR's flexibility makes it suitable to
    both very simple service implementations where the provider only responds to a
    set of pre-defined queries, or more advanced implementations where the provider
    software can dynamically parse complex queries referencing output models supplied
    by the client.

  purpose_detail: The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation
    languages or ontology languages for authoring ontologies or knowledge bases. The
    languages are characterized by formal semantics and RDF/XML-based serializations
    for the Semantic Web. OWL is endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and
    has attracted academic, medical and commercial interest. The OWL 2 Web Ontology
    Language, informally OWL 2, is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with
    formally defined meaning. OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals,
    and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can
    be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves
    are primarily exchanged as RDF documents.

  purpose_detail: The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is a way to specify data
    processing workflows with a human-readable and -writeable syntax. WDL makes it
    straightforward to define analysis tasks, chain them together in workflows, and
    parallelize their execution. The language makes common patterns simple to express,
    while also admitting uncommon or complicated behavior; and strives to achieve
    portability not only across execution platforms, but also different types of users.
    Whether one is an analyst, a programmer, an operator of a production system, or
    any other sort of user, WDL should be accessible and understandable.

  name: AIO
  purpose_detail: The Artificial Intelligence Ontology (AIO) is a comprehensive formal
    ontology that provides standardized terminology and semantic relationships for
    describing artificial intelligence systems, methods, and concepts. Developed to
    address the need for consistent AI terminology across research and applications,
    AIO models classes and relationships describing deep learning networks, their
    component layers and activation functions, machine learning algorithms, data processing
    techniques, and potential algorithmic biases. The ontology contains 443 classes
    organized in a hierarchical structure with a maximum depth of 5 levels, covering
    fundamental AI concepts from basic computational methods to complex neural architectures.
    AIO serves as a critical resource for AI researchers, practitioners, and systems
    developers who need standardized vocabularies for annotating AI models, describing
    experimental procedures, ensuring reproducibility, and enabling semantic interoperability
    between AI systems and databases. The ontology facilitates automated reasoning
    about AI systems, supports metadata annotation for AI workflows, and contributes
    to the broader goal of making artificial intelligence research more findable,
    accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

    description: AIO (Artificial Intelligence Ontology) is used in biomedical AI for
      standardizing the description of machine learning models, algorithms, and workflows,
      enabling semantic search for AI methods, automated model selection, and reproducible
      research documentation. Researchers leverage AIO to annotate AI models with
      formal descriptions of their architecture, training data requirements, and applicable
      use cases, facilitating discovery of appropriate models for specific biomedical
      tasks. The ontology supports automated reasoning about AI pipeline compatibility,
      enables knowledge graphs that link models to publications and datasets, and
      provides structured vocabulary for documenting AI experiments in compliance
      with reproducibility standards. AIO enables large language models to better
      understand and recommend AI approaches for biomedical problems.

  name: CVX
  purpose_detail: The Clinical Vaccines Administered (CVX) code set is a comprehensive
    standardized vocabulary developed and maintained by the CDC's National Center
    for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) that provides unique numeric
    identifiers for all vaccines available in the United States healthcare system.
    This essential code set includes both active vaccines currently available for
    patient administration and inactive vaccines that may appear in historical immunization
    records, enabling complete tracking of vaccination history across a patient's
    lifetime. CVX codes are specifically designed for use in HL7 Version 2.3.1 and
    2.5.1 immunization messages and electronic health record systems, facilitating
    standardized communication between healthcare providers, immunization information
    systems (IIS), and public health agencies. Each CVX code entry includes detailed
    information about vaccine status (active, inactive, pending, non-US, or never
    active), last update timestamp, and clinical notes providing context about usage
    and availability. When paired with MVX (manufacturer) codes, CVX codes can precisely
    identify specific trade-named vaccine products, supporting accurate inventory
    management, adverse event reporting, vaccine safety monitoring, and public health
    surveillance activities essential for maintaining population immunity and preventing
    vaccine-preventable diseases.

    description: EVI (Evidence Graph) ontology is used in AI applications for representing
      and reasoning over biomedical evidence from scientific literature, enabling
      automated hypothesis generation, evidence synthesis, and knowledge graph construction.
      Machine learning models leverage EVI's formal representation of claims, evidence
      types, and epistemic confidence to train systems that extract evidence-based
      relationships from publications, assess the quality and reliability of scientific
      findings, and generate evidence-weighted knowledge graphs. AI applications include
      automated systematic review, drug repurposing through evidence integration,
      and training of large language models that can cite and reason about scientific
      evidence with appropriate confidence levels. EVI enables AI systems to distinguish
      between different types of evidence and perform meta-analytic reasoning.

  description: Human Disease Ontology
  formal_specification: https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology
  is_open: true
  name: DOID
  purpose_detail: The Human Disease Ontology (DOID) is a comprehensive, standardized
    ontology that provides a hierarchical classification system for human diseases
    organized primarily by etiology (underlying cause). Developed as part of the Open
    Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry, DOID serves as a cornerstone reference for
    disease terminology in biomedical research, clinical informatics, and healthcare
    applications. The ontology integrates multiple disease classification systems
    including ICD, SNOMED CT, UMLS, and MeSH, providing extensive cross-references
    that enable interoperability between different medical coding systems. DOID structures
    diseases into logical hierarchies based on disease mechanisms, affected anatomical
    systems, and causal agents, enabling both broad categorical searches and precise
    disease identification. Each disease concept includes standardized names, definitions,
    synonyms, and relationships to parent and child terms, creating a rich semantic
    network that supports computational analysis of disease data. The ontology is
    extensively used in genomics databases, electronic health records, biomedical
    literature annotation, drug discovery pipelines, and epidemiological studies where
    consistent disease terminology is essential for data integration and comparative
    analysis.

    description: ITO (Immune Tolerance Ontology) is used in AI applications for standardizing
      immunological concepts and experimental data, enabling machine learning models
      to integrate diverse immune system datasets and predict immune responses. AI
      systems leverage ITO's structured representation of immune tolerance mechanisms,
      cell types, and molecular interactions to train models for vaccine response
      prediction, autoimmune disease risk assessment, and immunotherapy outcome forecasting.
      The ontology supports natural language processing of immunology literature,
      automated extraction of immune tolerance mechanisms from text, and semantic
      integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data in immunology
      research. ITO enables AI models to reason about complex immune system behaviors
      by providing formal relationships between immunological entities.

  description: MHC Restriction Ontology
  formal_specification: https://github.com/IEDB/MRO
  is_open: true
  name: MRO
  purpose_detail: The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Restriction Ontology
    (MRO) is a specialized ontology developed by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)
    to provide standardized terminology for describing MHC restriction phenomena in
    immunological experiments and data. MHC restriction refers to the biological process
    by which T-cell recognition of antigens is limited to peptides presented by specific
    MHC molecules that are compatible with the T-cell's own MHC background. MRO systematically
    organizes the complex relationships between MHC alleles, T-cell responses, and
    antigen presentation contexts that are crucial for understanding adaptive immune
    responses, vaccine development, and transplantation immunology. The ontology enables
    precise annotation of immunological experiments by providing controlled vocabulary
    terms for MHC class I and class II molecules, their allelic variants, restriction
    patterns, and associated experimental conditions. This standardization is essential
    for comparative immunology studies, epitope mapping projects, and the development
    of personalized immunotherapies where accurate description of MHC-restricted immune
    responses is critical for data interpretation and clinical translation.

  is_open: true
  name: PR
  purpose_detail: The Protein Ontology (PR) is a comprehensive formal ontology that
    provides standardized terminology and semantic relationships for describing protein-related
    entities across the complete spectrum of protein science. Developed by the PRotein
    Ontology consortium, PR serves as a unifying framework that integrates protein
    sequence, structure, and functional information into a coherent knowledge representation
    system. The ontology encompasses multiple levels of protein organization including
    protein families and complexes, individual protein molecules, protein domains
    and regions, post-translational modifications, and protein isoforms generated
    through alternative splicing or processing. PR maintains extensive cross-references
    to major protein databases including UniProt, NCBI, and Ensembl, enabling seamless
    integration with existing protein annotation resources. The ontology supports
    advanced protein function annotation by providing precise vocabulary for describing
    enzymatic activities, binding sites, regulatory mechanisms, and cellular localization
    patterns. PR is essential for proteomics data standardization, comparative protein
    analysis, functional genomics research, and systems biology applications where
    consistent protein terminology facilitates data integration, automated reasoning,
    and knowledge discovery across diverse experimental platforms.

    description: Bridge2AI Standards Registry is used to help researchers identify
      appropriate data standards, formats, and ontologies for creating AI-ready biomedical
      datasets across diverse domains. The registry supports AI development by cataloging
      standards relevant to machine learning applications, documenting their AI readiness
      characteristics, and providing guidance on standard selection for specific use
      cases. Researchers leverage the registry to discover standards that facilitate
      data integration across modalities, ensure interoperability of training datasets,
      and meet FAIR principles for AI model development. The registry itself demonstrates
      application of AI for semantic search, standards recommendation, and automated
      curation of standards metadata that helps bridge the gap between domain expertise
      and AI-ready data preparation.

    description: Aesara (successor to Theano) is used in biomedical AI for implementing
      probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian neural networks, and statistical inference
      algorithms that quantify uncertainty in clinical predictions. Researchers leverage
      Aesara's symbolic math capabilities and automatic differentiation to build sophisticated
      probabilistic models for tasks like uncertainty-aware disease risk prediction,
      Bayesian optimization of drug dosing regimens, and hierarchical models for multi-center
      clinical studies. The library enables AI applications that provide calibrated
      confidence intervals for predictions, perform approximate Bayesian inference
      through variational methods, and integrate domain knowledge through informative
      priors. Aesara is particularly valuable when prediction uncertainty quantification
      is critical for clinical decision-making.

    name: Ordinal Classification for Clinical Severity and Staging
    description: CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) framework is used in biomedical AI
      for ordinal classification tasks where class labels have natural ordering, such
      as disease severity grading, cancer staging, and pain scale prediction. Deep
      learning models leverage CORAL's specialized loss functions and neural network
      architectures to maintain ordinality constraints, improving prediction of intermediate
      classes and ensuring that predictions respect the clinical ordering of outcomes.
      The approach is particularly valuable in medical applications where misclassifying
      stage II as stage IV is more serious than predicting stage III, enabling models
      that better capture the graduated nature of clinical assessments. CORAL enables
      more accurate and clinically meaningful predictions for tasks like histological
      grading, functional status assessment, and radiological severity scoring.

  formal_specification: https://github.com/yanailab/enhance
  is_open: true
  name: ENHANCE
  publication: doi:10.1101/655365
  purpose_detail: ENHANCE is a computational method for accurate denoising of single-cell
    RNA-sequencing data that addresses technical noise while preserving biological
    signal. The algorithm uses k-nearest neighbor aggregation to identify similar
    cells, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) to remove noise components
    while retaining significant biological variation. The method automatically determines
    the optimal number of neighbors (k) based on target transcript counts and identifies
    significant principal components using variance fold-thresholding against simulated
    noise datasets. ENHANCE processes UMI-count matrices in tab-separated format,
    supports gzip compression, and provides configurable parameters for neighbor selection,
    PC threshold determination, and precision control. The tool enhances downstream
    analyses such as clustering, trajectory inference, and differential expression
    by reducing technical artifacts while maintaining cell type distinctions and biological
    relationships in single-cell transcriptomic data.

  purpose_detail: fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with
    high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results
    in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components
    that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things
    without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This
    is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common
    underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms
    of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly
    by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility
    of the PyTorch library.

  publication: doi:10.1016/j.simpa.2022.100421
  purpose_detail: 'MLPro (Machine Learning Professional) is a middleware framework
    for standardized machine learning development in Python. The framework provides
    an object-oriented architecture that enables the integration and standardization
    of multiple machine learning paradigms through reusable process models and templates.
    MLPro consists of several sub-frameworks organized as modules: MLPro-BF (Basic
    Functions) provides cross-sectional infrastructure including mathematics, data
    management, plotting capabilities, and logging; MLPro-SL supports supervised learning
    workflows; MLPro-RL implements reinforcement learning processes; MLPro-GT covers
    game theory applications; and MLPro-OA focuses on online adaptive machine learning.
    The architecture uses standardized interfaces that allow ML models to be embedded
    into training pipelines and operational workflows in a modular fashion. The framework
    integrates with external machine learning libraries including River (for online
    learning), scikit-learn (for supervised learning), and OpenML (for dataset and
    experiment management), providing wrappers that standardize their usage within
    MLPro processes. Development follows object-oriented design principles with test-driven
    development for quality assurance and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD)
    practices. The framework includes an extension hub for third-party integrations,
    comprehensive documentation with API references, and an example pool demonstrating
    various use cases. MLPro supports hybrid ML applications that combine multiple
    learning paradigms and real-time adaptive systems. The project is developed and
    maintained by the Group for Automation Technology and Learning Systems at South
    Westphalia University of Applied Sciences in Germany. The source code is released
    under the Apache 2.0 license and is available through PyPI for installation.'

    description: MLPro is used in biomedical AI for developing reinforcement learning
      agents that learn optimal treatment strategies, adaptive monitoring protocols,
      and personalized intervention policies through interaction with healthcare environments.
      Researchers leverage MLPro's modular framework to implement and compare different
      RL algorithms for applications like dynamic treatment regimen optimization,
      adaptive clinical trial design, and automated ICU management. The platform supports
      simulation-based learning where agents train on synthetic patients before clinical
      deployment, multi-agent systems for coordinated care, and safe exploration strategies
      essential for healthcare applications. MLPro enables systematic evaluation of
      RL approaches for sequential decision-making problems in medicine where actions
      have long-term consequences.

    description: MuSIC (Multi-Scale Integrated Cell classification) is used in AI
      applications for automated cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data
      by leveraging reference datasets and hierarchical classification strategies.
      The tool employs machine learning algorithms that integrate multiple sources
      of evidence including marker genes, reference atlases, and cross-dataset mapping
      to assign cell type labels with confidence scores. AI systems build upon MuSIC's
      probabilistic framework to develop more sophisticated deep learning models for
      cell state identification, rare cell type discovery, and cross-species cell
      type mapping. The multi-scale approach enables AI models to make predictions
      at varying levels of granularity, from broad cell classes to fine-grained subtypes,
      which is essential for biological interpretation and downstream analysis.

    description: PyTorch is the dominant framework for biomedical AI research, used
      extensively for developing deep learning models across medical imaging, genomics,
      drug discovery, and clinical prediction. Researchers leverage PyTorch's dynamic
      computational graphs, extensive ecosystem (torchvision, torchaudio, TorchIO),
      and pretrained models to build custom neural architectures for tasks like cancer
      detection in pathology images, protein structure prediction, medical report
      generation, and patient outcome forecasting. PyTorch's flexibility enables rapid
      prototyping of novel architectures, its strong academic community supports reproducible
      research through shared model implementations, and its production deployment
      tools (TorchServe, TorchScript) facilitate clinical translation of research
      models.

  purpose_detail: Relexi is an open source reinforcement learning (RL) framework written
    in Python and based on TensorFlow's RL library TF-Agents. Relexi allows to employ
    RL for environments that require computationally intensive simulations like applications
    in computational fluid dynamics. For this, Relexi couples legacy simulation codes
    with the RL library TF-Agents at scale on modern high-performance computing (HPC)
    hardware using the SmartSim library. Relexi thus provides an easy way to explore
    the potential of RL for HPC applications.

    name: Explainable Reinforcement Learning for Clinical Decision Support
    description: Relexi is used in biomedical AI for developing interpretable reinforcement
      learning systems that can explain their decision-making process, crucial for
      clinical applications where treatment recommendations must be understandable
      to physicians. The framework enables training of RL agents for sequential clinical
      decisions (medication dosing, ventilator management, treatment timing) while
      maintaining explainability through attention mechanisms and policy distillation.
      Relexi supports safe exploration in healthcare settings by incorporating domain
      constraints and enabling clinicians to understand why specific actions are recommended.
      Applications include explainable sepsis treatment protocols, interpretable insulin
      dosing algorithms, and transparent clinical trial enrollment strategies where
      understanding the agent's reasoning is essential for clinical trust and regulatory
      approval.

      emerged. The library's symbolic computation approach and automatic differentiation
      influenced the design of current frameworks, and understanding Theano remains
      valuable for historical context in AI research. While active development has
      ceased (succeeded by Aesara), Theano-based code remains in production in some
      clinical settings and research archives.

  has_relevant_organization:
  - B2AI_ORG:34
  is_open: true
  name: WES
  purpose_detail: The Workflow Execution Service (WES) is a GA4GH standard API specification
    that provides a platform-agnostic approach for submitting and monitoring workflow
    execution across different computational environments. WES enables researchers
    to run standardized workflows, currently supporting Common Workflow Language (CWL)
    and Workflow Description Language (WDL) formats, on multiple platforms, clouds,
    and execution systems using a consistent interface. The API specification is written
    in OpenAPI and embodies RESTful service principles, using JSON for requests and
    responses with standard HTTP/HTTPS transport. Core functionality includes workflow
    submission with parameter passing, run status monitoring through detailed logs
    capturing stdout and stderr output, task-level execution tracking with timing
    and exit codes, and workflow cancellation capabilities. WES addresses critical
    use cases such as "bring your code to the data" scenarios where researchers submit
    custom analyses to run on externally-owned datasets without data transfer, and
    best-practices pipeline execution where researchers discover workflows from shared
    repositories like Dockstore and execute them over controlled data environments.
    The service implements OAuth2 bearer token authentication and authorization, with
    implementations responsible for verifying user credentials and enforcing submission
    policies. WES provides comprehensive service introspection through its service-info
    endpoint, reporting supported workflow types, versions, filesystem protocols,
    workflow engines, and system state information. The API supports paginated listing
    of workflow runs, detailed run logs with output file locations, and granular task-level
    monitoring. Run states include QUEUED, INITIALIZING, RUNNING, COMPLETE, EXECUTOR_ERROR,
    SYSTEM_ERROR, CANCELED, and PREEMPTED, enabling detailed tracking of workflow
    execution lifecycle. As a GA4GH standard, WES promotes interoperability across
    bioinformatics workflow execution platforms and supports integration with related
    GA4GH standards including the Data Object Service for credential management and
    the Task Execution Service for extended task definitions.

  formal_specification: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/specs
  is_open: true
  name: Frictionless
  purpose_detail: Frictionless data standards provide a comprehensive suite of lightweight,
    extensible specifications for describing datasets, data files, and tabular data
    to enhance FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) principles.
    The core specifications include Data Package for dataset-level metadata and resource
    collections, Data Resource for individual file descriptions, and Table Schema
    for tabular data structure definition with field types, constraints, and relationships.
    These specifications combine to create specialized formats like Tabular Data Packages
    that integrate CSV/JSON data with JSON Schema-based metadata descriptors. The
    standards follow a "small pieces, loosely joined" philosophy, enabling individual
    components to be used independently or combined for complex data scenarios. They
    support cross-technology implementation with human-readable JSON metadata that
    facilitates machine processing, data validation, and automated discovery. The
    specifications enable data portability, version control, and collaborative data
    workflows while maintaining compatibility with existing data formats and tools
    in the data science ecosystem.

    description: Frictionless Data standards are used in biomedical AI for defining
      data schemas, validating input data quality, and ensuring consistency in training
      datasets across institutions and time periods. Machine learning pipelines leverage
      Frictionless specifications (Data Package, Table Schema) to automatically validate
      clinical and research datasets before model training, detect schema drift that
      could degrade model performance, and document data transformations applied during
      preprocessing. The framework enables reproducible data handling by making dataset
      structures and validation rules explicit, supports continuous data quality monitoring
      in production ML systems, and facilitates data sharing by providing machine-readable
      documentation of expected data formats and constraints.

  purpose_detail: MI-CLAIM (Minimum Information about CLinical AI Modeling) is a reporting
    standard and documentation checklist developed to address transparency and reproducibility
    challenges in clinical artificial intelligence research, published in Nature Medicine
    in 2020 by a multidisciplinary team of clinical and data scientists. MI-CLAIM
    serves two primary purposes - enabling direct assessment of clinical impact including
    fairness considerations, and allowing rapid replication of the technical design
    process for clinical AI studies. The standard provides a comprehensive checklist
    in MS Word table format covering essential reporting elements including study
    design and data characteristics (patient demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria,
    data sources, temporal validation), model development details (feature engineering,
    architecture selection, hyperparameter tuning, training procedures), performance
    evaluation (metrics across demographic subgroups, confidence intervals, comparison
    to clinical standards), clinical implementation considerations (decision thresholds,
    interpretability mechanisms, failure modes), and ethical aspects (bias assessment,
    fairness metrics, regulatory status). The repository encourages community feedback
    through GitHub Issues to continuously improve the standard as the field evolves,
    promoting best practices for transparent, reproducible, and equitable clinical
    AI development and deployment across healthcare applications.

      large imaging datasets, and provides the foundation for medical imaging data
      loaders in PyTorch and TensorFlow. pydicom's ability to preserve clinical metadata
      during AI processing ensures that model outputs maintain appropriate associations
      with patient context and imaging parameters.

  publication: doi:10.1007/s10278-024-00982-6
  purpose_detail: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning
    techniques require access to large inter-institutional cohorts of data to enable
    the development of robust models, e.g., targeting the identification of disease
    biomarkers and quantifying disease progression and treatment efficacy. The Observational
    Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) has been designed to
    accommodate a harmonized representation of observational healthcare data. This
    study proposes the Medical Imaging CDM (MI-CDM) extension, adding two new tables
    and two vocabularies to the OMOP CDM to address the structural and semantic requirements
    to support imaging research. The tables provide the capabilities of linking DICOM
    data sources as well as tracking the provenance of imaging features derived from
    those images. The implementation of the extension enables phenotype definitions
    using imaging features and expanding standardized computable imaging biomarkers.
    This proposal offers a comprehensive and unified approach for conducting imaging
    research and outcome studies utilizing imaging features.

    RDFa, Microdata, and JSON-LD. As of 2024, over 45 million web domains use Schema.org
    markup with over 450 billion Schema.org objects. The vocabulary is continuously
    evolving through an open community process managed by the W3C Schema.org Community
    Group.

    name: Biomedical Knowledge Extraction and Semantic Search
    description: Schema.org vocabularies, particularly the biomedical extensions (BioSchemas),
      are used in AI applications for automated knowledge extraction from web resources,
      semantic annotation of datasets, and training large language models on structured
      biomedical information. AI systems leverage Schema.org markup to extract structured
      data about proteins, genes, diseases, clinical trials, and medical conditions
      from web pages, enabling automated knowledge base construction and question-answering
      systems. The vocabulary supports AI-driven dataset discovery, metadata standardization
      for machine learning pipelines, and training of biomedical language models that
      understand relationships between biological entities. Schema.org's widespread
      adoption makes it valuable for web-scale biomedical data mining and federated
      search applications.

  name: Thermo Fisher RAW
  purpose_detail: The Thermo Fisher RAW format is a proprietary file format designed
    for storing mass spectrometry data generated by Thermo Fisher Scientific instruments.
    It contains detailed information about mass spectra, chromatograms, instrument
    parameters, and metadata from experimental runs. The format supports multiple
    mass spectrometry techniques and is accessed through Thermo's software tools like
    MSFileReader or more recent RawFileReader. While it's proprietary, various conversion
    tools allow transformation to open formats like mzML or mzXML for broader compatibility
    with third-party analysis software. The format is widely used in proteomics, metabolomics,
    and other mass spectrometry-based research applications where preserving the complete
    experimental context is essential for data interpretation and analysis.
