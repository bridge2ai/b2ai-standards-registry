    contigs. The original ACE format was developed for use with Consed, a program
    for viewing, editing, and finishing DNA sequence assemblies. ACE files are generated
    by various assembly programs, including Phrap, CAP3, Newbler, Arachne, AMOS (sequence
    assembly) (more specifically Minimo) and Tigr Assembler v2.

  purpose_detail: The Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD) Schema is an evolving
    comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens
    and observations (a.k.a. primary biodiversity data). The ABCD Schema attempts
    to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide variety
    of databases. It is compatible with several existing data standards. Parallel
    structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated.
    Version 1.2 is currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information
    Facility) and BioCASE (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe) networks.
    Apart from the GBIF and BioCASE networks, the potential for the application of
    ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets
    from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's
    own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible). By defining relations
    between terms, ABCD is a step towards an ontology for biological collections.

  purpose_detail: The Analytical Information Markup Language (AnIML) is the emerging
    ASTM XML standard for analytical chemistry data. It is currently in pre-release
    form. It is a combination of a highly flexible core schema that defines XML tagging
    for any kind of analytical information; A set of technique definition documents.
    These XML files, one per analytical technique, apply tight constraints to the
    flexible core and in turn are defined by the Technique Schema; Extensions to Technique
    Definitions are possible to accommodate vendor- and institution-specific data
    fields. Mission Statement Our goal is to serve as the open-source development
    platform for a new XML standard for Analytical Chemistry Information. The project
    is a collaborative effort between many groups and individuals and is sanctioned
    by the ASTM subcommittee E13.15. http://animl.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/animl/schema/animl-core.xsd

    have been defined. The guideline describes the mandatory (and useful) information
    that should be mentioned in literature articles to facilitate the curation process.
    These guidelines extend the minimal information defined by the MISFISHIE format

  purpose_detail: BioPAX is a standard language that aims to enable integration, exchange,
    visualization and analysis of biological pathway data. Specifically, BioPAX supports
    data exchange between pathway data groups and thus reduces the complexity of interchange
    between data formats by providing an accepted standard format for pathway data.
    By offering a standard, with well-defined semantics for pathway representation,
    BioPAX allows pathway databases and software to interact more efficiently. In
    addition, BioPAX enables the development of pathway visualization from databases
    and facilitates analysis of experimentally generated data through combination
    with prior knowledge. The BioPAX effort is coordinated closely with that of other
    pathway related standards initiatives namely; PSI-MI, SBML, CellML, and SBGN in
    order to deliver a compatible standard in the areas where they overlap.

  has_relevant_organization:
  - B2AI_ORG:72
  purpose_detail: Human biospecimens are subject to a number of different collection,
    processing, and storage factors that can significantly alter their molecular composition
    and consistency. These biospecimen preanalytical factors, in turn, influence experimental
    outcomes and the ability to reproduce scientific results. Currently, the extent
    and type of information specific to the biospecimen preanalytical conditions reported
    in scientific publications and regulatory submissions varies widely. To improve
    the quality of research utilizing human tissues, it is critical that information
    regarding the handling of biospecimens be reported in a thorough, accurate, and
    standardized manner. The Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality (BRISQ)
    recommendations outlined herein are intended to apply to any study in which human
    biospecimens are used. The purpose of reporting these details is to supply others,
    from researchers to regulators, with more consistent and standardized information
    to better evaluate, interpret, compare, and reproduce the experimental results.
    The BRISQ guidelines are proposed as an important and timely resource tool to
    strengthen communication and publications around biospecimen-related research
    and help reassure patient contributors and the advocacy community that the contributions
    are valued and respected

  purpose_detail: The CDISC Case Report Tabulation Data Definition Specification (define.xml)
    Version 1.0 reflects changes from a comment period through the Health Level 7
    (HL7) Regulated Clinical Research Information Management Technical Committee (RCRIM)
    in December 2003 (www.hl7.org) and CDISC's website in September 2004 as well as
    the work done by the define.xml team in conjunction with the CDISC ODM team to
    add functionality, features, and additional documentation. This document specifies
    the standard for providing Case Report Tabulations Data Definitions in an XML
    format for submission to regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA). The XML schema used
    to define the expected structure for these XML files is based on an extension
    to the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM). The 1999 FDA electronic submission
    (eSub) guidance and the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) documents
    specify that a document describing the content and structure of the included data
    should be provided within a submission. This document is known as the Data Definition
    Document (e.g., define.pdf in the 1999 guidance). The Data Definition Document
    provides a list of the datasets included in the submission along with a detailed
    description of the contents of each dataset. To increase the level of automation
    and improve the efficiency of the Regulatory Review process, define.xml can be
    used to provide the Data Definition Document in a machine-readable format.

  description: Chemical Markup Language

  concerns_data_topic:
  - B2AI_TOPIC:3
  purpose_detail: CML (Chemical Markup Language) is an XML language designed to hold
    most of the central concepts in chemistry. It was the first language to be developed
    and plays the same role for chemistry as MathML for mathematics and GML for geographical
    systems. CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules, reactions,
    solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a special flexible approach
    to numeric science it also covers a very wide range of chemical properties, parameters
    and experimental observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication
    between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been heavily informed
    by the current chemical scholarly literature and chemical databases. XML is a
    mainstream approach providing semantics for science, such as MathML, SBML/BIOPAX
    (biology), GML and KML (geo) SVG (graphics) and NLM-DTD, ODT and OOXML (documents).
    CML provides support for most chemistry, especially molecules, compounds, reactions,
    spectra, crystals and computational chemistry (compchem). CML has been developed
    by Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa since 1995. It is the de facto XML for chemistry,
    accepted by publishers and with more than 1 million lines of Open Source code
    supporting it. CML can be validated and built into authoring tools (for example
    the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Word). A list of CML-compliant and CML-aware
    software can be found on the software page. The infrastructure includes legacy
    converters, dictionaries and conventions, Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. There
    are several versions of the CML schema. The most recent schema is schema 3. This
    essentially relaxes many of the constraints imposed in the previous stable release
    (schema 2.4), allowing users to put together the elements and attributes in a
    more flexible manner to fit the data that they want to represent more easily.

    all data needed for macromolecular NMR spectroscopy from the initial experimental
    data to the final validation. It serves for exchange of data between programs,
    for storage, data harvesting, and database deposition. The data model proper is
    an abstract description of the relevant data and their relationships - it is implemented
    in the modeling language UML. From this CCPN autogenerates interfaces (APIs) for
    various languages, format description and I/O routines, and documentation.

  purpose_detail: This dataset outlines a proposed set of core, minimal metadata elements
    that can be used to describe biomedical datasets, such as those resulting from
    research funded by the National Institutes of Health. It can inform efforts to
    better catalog or index such data to improve discoverability. The proposed metadata
    elements are based on an analysis of the metadata schemas used in a set of NIH-supported
    data sharing repositories. Common elements from these data repositories were identified,
    mapped to existing data-specific metadata standards from to existing multidisciplinary
    data repositories, DataCite and Dryad, and compared with metadata used in MEDLINE
    records to establish a sustainable and integrated metadata schema.

  description: Description Language for Taxonomy
  collection:
  - markuplanguage
  concerns_data_topic:
  - B2AI_TOPIC:5
  purpose_detail: When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs,
    the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a particular
    program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data that can be represented,
    and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with
    a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions
    of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters
    to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially
    in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured
    by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system
    was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use
    by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile
    enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data.
    Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if
    computer processing of the data is not envisaged.

  purpose_detail: This standard provides a system whereby uses of plants (in their
    cultural context) can be described, using standardised descriptors and terms,
    and attached to taxonomic data sets. It resulted from discussions at the International
    Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for Plant Sciences (TDWG) between 1989 and
    1992. Users and potential users of the standard include economic botanists and
    ethnobotanists whose purpose is to record all known information about the uses
    of a taxon; educationalists, taxonomists, biochemists, anatomists etc. who wish
    to record plant use, often at a broad level; economic botany collection curators
    who need to describe accurately the uses and values of specimens in their collections;
    bibliographers who need to describe plant uses referred to in publications and
    to apply keywords consistently for ease of data retrieval. While this standard
    is still in use, it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the
    TDWG website).

    is simple and independent of hard- or software environments. It allows for any
    local montages, transducers, prefiltering, sampling frequencies, etc. At present,
    7 laboratories in various countries have used the format for exchanging sleep-wake
    recordings. These exchanges have made it possible to create a common database
    of sleep records, to compare the analysis algorithms local to the various laboratories
    to each other by applying these algorithms to identical signals, and to set up
    a computer-aided interlaboratory evaluation of manual and automatic analysis methods.

  purpose_detail: The flow cytometry data file standard provides the specifications
    needed to completely describe flow cytometry data sets within the confines of
    the file containing the experimental data. In 1984, the first Flow Cytometry Standard
    format for data files was adopted as FCS 1.0. This standard was modified in 1990
    as FCS 2.0 and again in 1997 as FCS 3.0. We report here on the next generation
    Flow Cytometry Standard data file format. FCS 3.1 is a minor revision based on
    suggested improvements from the community. The unchanged goal of the Standard
    is to provide a uniform file format that allows files created by one type of acquisition
    hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type.

  purpose_detail: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) is
    a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure four domains of HRQOL in cancer patients
    - Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. Original development
    and validation involved 854 patients with cancer and 15 oncology specialists.
    An initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer
    was generated by open-ended interviews with patients experienced with the symptoms
    of cancer and oncology professionals. Using preselected criteria, items were reduced
    to a 38-item general version. Factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on
    545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 27-item FACT-General
    (FACT-G). Coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. The scale's
    ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance
    status rating (PSR), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity. It has
    also demonstrated sensitivity to change over time.

  purpose_detail: Functional genomics experiments present many challenges in data
    archiving, sharing and querying. As the size and complexity of data generated
    from such experiments grows, so does the requirement for standard data formats.
    To address these needs, the Functional Genomics Experiment [Object Model / Markup-Language]
    (FuGE-OM, FuGE-ML) has been created to facilitate the development of data standards.FuGE
    is a model of the shared components in different functional genomics domains.
    FuGE facilitates the development of data standards in functional genomics in two
    ways. 1. FuGE provides a model of common components in functional genomics investigations,
    such as materials, data, protocols, equipment and software. These models can be
    extended to develop modular data formats with consistent structure. 2. FuGE provides
    a framework for capturing complete laboratory workflows, enabling the integration
    of pre-existing data formats. In this context, FuGE allows the capture of additional
    metadata that gives formats a context within the complete workflow. FuGE is available
    as a UML model and an XML Schema

  purpose_detail: The Gating-ML specification represents a proposal on how to form
    unambiguous XML-based gate definitions that may be used independently as well
    as included as one of the components of ACS. Such a description of gates can facilitate
    the interchange and validation of data between different software packages with
    the potential of significant increase of hardware and software interoperability.
    The specification supports rectangular gates in n dimensions (i.e., from one-dimensional
    range gates up to n-dimensional hyper-rectangular regions), polygon gates in two
    (and more) dimensions, ellipsoid gates in n dimensions, decision tree structures,
    and Boolean collections of any of the types of gates. Gates can be uniquely identified
    and may be ordered into a hierarchical structure to describe a gating strategy.
    Gates may be applied on parameters as in list mode data files (e.g., FCS files)
    or on transformed parameters as described by any explicit parameter transformation.
    Therefore, since version 1.5, parameter transformation and compensation description
    are included as part of the Gating-ML specification.

  purpose_detail: The Gene Ontology project provides annotations describing attributes
    of biological entities such as genes and gene products. The Gene Ontology has
    historically provided annotations via Gene Association Format (GAF), including
    GAF-1 and GAF-2. Ontologies are distributed separately, using an OWL serialization
    or OBO format. The use of GAF has some drawbacks. Combined representation of gene/gene
    product data and annotations leads to redundancy/repetition No way to represent
    gene/gene product metadata for unannotated genes Requirement to maintain backward
    compatibility makes it harder to introduce enhancements such as use of an ontology
    for evidence types GAF formats will continue to be supported, but the need for
    a way to represent genes/gene products separately from annotations, as well as
    the need to use the evidence ontology has lead to the creation of the GPAD (Gene
    Product Annotation Data) and GPI (Gene Product Information) formats, defined here.
    Whilst GPAD and GPI have been defined for use within the Gene Ontology Consortium
    for GO annotation, this specification is designed to be reusable for analagous
    ontology-based annotation - for example, gene phenotype annotation.

  - B2AI_TOPIC:20
  purpose_detail: GlycoCT format is devised to describe the carbohydrate sequences,
    with a controlled vocabulary to name monosaccharides, adopting IUPAC rules to
    generate a consistent, machine-readable nomenclature, based on a connection table
    approach, instead of a linear encoding scheme. The format uses a block concept
    to describe frequently occurring special features of carbohydrate sequences like
    repeating units. It exists in two variants, a condensed form and a more verbose
    XML syntax. Sorting rules assure the uniqueness of the condensed form, thus making
    it suitable as a direct primary key for database applications, which rely on unique
    identifiers. GlycoCT encompasses the capabilities of the heterogeneous landscape
    of digital encoding schemata in glycomics and is thus a step forward on the way
    to a unified and broadly accepted sequence format in glycobioinformatics.

  description: HL7 Arden Syntax
  has_relevant_organization:
  - B2AI_ORG:40
  purpose_detail: The Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems Version 2.10 is the latest
    version of a formalism for clinical knowledge representation that can be used
    by clinicians, knowledge engineers, administrators and others to implement clinical
    decision support (CDS) solutions to help improve the quality and safety of care.
    Arden Syntax can be used to create a knowledge base for CDS systems that, when
    coupled with patient data, can generate patient-specific CDS interventions for
    improving patient care. The key change in Version 2.10 over Version 2.9 is inclusion
    of a normative XML representation for Arden Syntax. This was done because the
    use of XML facilitates the development of tools such as syntax checkers and editors
    that can help increase the correctness of executable knowledge modules, and this
    in turn will foster the augmentation of the development and production environments
    for Arden, thereby increasing its utility.

  purpose_detail: Currently, it is common that a single data element is used to capture
    both sex and gender information, often assuming these two items are one unified
    idea. This specification challenges that notion and proposes that independent
    consideration of sex and gender, and the assessment of their differences promotes
    the health of women, men, and people of diverse gender identities of all ages,
    avoiding systematic errors that generate results with a low validity (if any)
    in clinical studies. The Gender Harmony model describes an approach that can improve
    data accuracy for sex and gender information in health care systems.

  purpose_detail: The JCAMP-DX was one of the earliest specifications providing a
    standard file format for data exchange in mass spectrometry. It was initially
    developed for infrared spectrometry and related chemical and physical information
    between spectrometer data systems of different manufacture. It was also used later
    for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. JCAMP-DX is an ASCII based format
    and therefore not very compact even though it includes standards for file compression.
    All data are stored as labeled fields of variable length using printable ASCII
    characters. JCAMP-DX was officially released in 1988. JCAMP-DX was found impractical
    for today's large MS data sets, but it is still used for exchanging moderate numbers
    of spectra. IUPAC is currently in charge of its maintenance and the latest protocol
    is from 2005.

  purpose_detail: Sharing of microarray data within the research community has been
    greatly facilitated by the development of the disclosure and communication standards
    MIAME and MAGE-ML by the FGED Society. However, the complexity of the MAGE-ML
    format has made its use impractical for laboratories lacking dedicated bioinformatics
    support. We propose a simple tab-delimited, spreadsheet-based format, MAGE-TAB,
    which will become a part of the MAGE microarray data standard and can be used
    for annotating and communicating microarray data in a MIAME compliant fashion.
    MAGE-TAB will enable laboratories without bioinformatics experience or support
    to manage, exchange and submit well-annotated microarray data in a standard format
    using a spreadsheet. The MAGE-TAB format is self-contained, and does not require
    an understanding of MAGE-ML or XML

    multiple alignments at the DNA level between entire genomes. Previously used formats
    are suitable for multiple alignments of single proteins or regions of DNA without
    rearrangements, but would require considerable extension to cope with genomic
    issues such as forward and reverse strand directions, multiple pieces to the alignment,
    and so forth.

  purpose_detail: From 2005-2008 there has existed two separate XML formats for encoding
    raw spectrometer output, mzData developed by the PSI and mzXML developed at the
    Seattle Proteome Center at the Institute for Systems Biology. It was recognized
    that the existence of two separate formats for essentially the same thing generated
    confusion and required extra programming effort. Therefore the PSI, with full
    participation by ISB, has developed a new format by taking the best aspects of
    each of the precursor formats to form a single one. It is intended to replace
    the previous two formats. This new format was originally given a working name
    of dataXML. The final name is mzML.

  purpose_detail: The mzQuantML standard format is intended to store the systematic
    description of workflows quantifying molecules (principly peptides and proteins)
    by mass spectrometry. A large number of different software packages are available
    that produce output in a variety of different formats. It is intended that mzQuantML
    will provide a common format for the export of identification results from any
    software package. The format was originally developed under the name AnalysisXML
    as a format for several types of computational analyses performed over mass spectra
    in the proteomics context. It has been decided to split development into two formats,
    mzIdentML for peptide and protein identification and mzQuantML (described here),
    covering quantitative proteomic data derived from MS. The development of mzQuantML
    is driven by some general principles, specific use cases and the goal of supporting
    specific techniques, as listed below. These were discussed and agreed at the development
    meeting in Tubingen in July 2011.

    At times, this results in decisions that are not based in relational database
    modeling principles such as normalization. The model is designed to facilitate
    routine and rapid execution of distributed complex analytics. To meet this design
    requirement, some fields are duplicated across multiple tables to support faster
    analytic operations for distributed querying. The PCORnet CDM is based on the
    FDA Mini-Sentinel CDM. This allows PCORnet to more easily leverage the large array
    of analytic tools and expertise developed for the MSCDM v4.0, including data characterization
    approaches and the various tools for complex distributed analytics.

  purpose_detail: Natural Collections Description (NCD) (A data standard for exchanging

    collections of natural history materials at the collection level; one NCD record
    describes one entire collection. Collection descriptions are electronic records
    that document the holdings of an organisation as groups of items, which complement
    the more traditional item-level records such as are produced for a single specimen
    or a library book. NCD is tailored to natural history. It lies between general
    resource discovery standards such as Dublin Core (DC) and rich collection description
    standards such as the Encoded Archival Description (EAD). The NCD standard covers
    all types of natural history collections, such as specimens, original artwork,
    archives, observations, library materials, datasets, photographs or mixed collections
    such as those that result from expeditions and voyages of discovery.

    was perhaps the lack of adequate information about orientation in space, such
    that the stored data could not be unambiguously interpreted. Although the file
    was used by many different imaging software, the lack of adequate information
    on orientation obliged some, most notably spm, to include, for every analyze file,
    an accompanying file describing the orientation, such as a file with extension
    .mat.

  purpose_detail: The quality of research in hospital epidemiology (infection control)
    must be improved to be robust enough to influence policy and practice. In order
    to raise the standards of research and publication, a CONSORT equivalent for these
    largely quasi-experimental studies has been prepared by the authors of two relevant
    systematic reviews undertaken for the HTA and the Cochrane Collaboration. The
    statement was revised following widespread consultation with learned societies,
    editors of journals and researchers. It consists of a 22 item checklist, and a
    summary table. The emphasis is on transparency to improve the quality of reporting
    and on the use of appropriate statistical techniques.The statement has been endorsed
    and welcomed by a number of professional special interest groups and societies
    including the Association of Medical Microbiologists (AMM), Bristish Society for
    Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and the Infection Control Nurses' Association
    (ICNA) Research and Development Group. Like CONSORT, ORION considers itself a
    work in progress, which requires ongoing dialogue for successful promotion and
    dissemination. The statement is therefore offered for further public discussion
    and journals are encouraged to trial it as part of their reviewing and editing
    process and feedback to the authors.

  purpose_detail: An XML format for quality-related data of mass spectrometry and
    other high-throughput experiments. Quality control is increasingly recognized
    as a crucial aspect of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Several recent papers
    discuss relevant parameters for quality control and present applications to extract
    these from the instrumental raw data. What has been missing, however, is a standard
    data exchange format for reporting these performance metrics. We therefore developed
    the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the
    related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics
    Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for
    the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format
    and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational
    storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe
    the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example
    of the subsequent analysis possibilities. All information about qcML is available

  purpose_detail: The RDML file format is developed by the RDML consortium (http://www.rdml.org)
    and can be used free of charge. The RDML file format was created to encourage
    the exchange, publication, revision and re-analysis of raw qPCR data. The core
    of an RDML file is an experiment, not a PCR run. Therefore all the information
    is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the
    file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master
    elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure
    allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to
    provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a
    structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR)
    data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the
    experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard
    is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent
    exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data
    analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors,
    peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this
    standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well
    as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import
    and export of RDML data files.

  purpose_detail: REFLECT stands for Reporting guidElines For randomized controLled
    trials for livEstoCk and food safeTy. It is an evidence-based minimum set of items
    for trials reporting production, health, and food-safety outcomes.The aim of the
    REFLECT Statement is to help authors improve the reporting livestock trials with
    production, health, and food-safety outcomes. We have focused on both types of
    randomized trials, field trials and challenge studies in livestock, and the interventions
    may be therapeutic or preventive. The REFLECT Statement consists of a 22-item
    checklist (MS Word version ; PDF word version). It is an evolving document that
    is subject to change periodically as new evidence emerges. This website contains
    the current definitive version of the REFLECT Statement.

  description: Reporting recommendations for tumour Marker prognostic studies
  collection:
  - guidelines
  purpose_detail: Despite years of research and hundreds of reports on tumor markers
    in oncology, the number of markers that have emerged as clinically useful is pitifully
    small. Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent
    studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand
    in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt
    to understand the reasons why multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing
    conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these
    discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported
    in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information
    to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability
    of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker
    studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation
    for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on
    Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized
    trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines
    to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses,
    patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis
    methods. In addition, the guidelines provide helpful suggestions on how to present
    data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines
    is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information
    will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and
    understand the context in which the conclusions apply.

  purpose_detail: Making sense of rapidly evolving evidence on genetic associations
    is crucial to making genuine advances in human genomics and the eventual integration
    of this information in the practice of medicine and public health. Assessment
    of the strengths and weaknesses of this evidence, and hence the ability to synthesize
    it, has been limited by inadequate reporting of results. The STrengthening the
    REporting of Genetic Association studies (STREGA) initiative builds on the Strengthening
    the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement and
    provides additions to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The additions
    concern population stratification, genotyping errors, modelling haplotype variation,
    Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, replication, selection of participants, rationale
    for choice of genes and variants, treatment effects in studying quantitative traits,
    statistical methods, relatedness, reporting of descriptive and outcome data, and
    the volume of data issues that are important to consider in genetic association
    studies. The STREGA recommendations do not prescribe or dictate how a genetic
    association study should be designed but seek to enhance the transparency of its
    reporting, regardless of choices made during design, conduct, or analysis.

  purpose_detail: STROBE stands for an international, collaborative initiative of
    epidemiologists, methodologists, statisticians, researchers and journal editors
    involved in the conduct and dissemination of observational studies, with the common
    aim of STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology. The
    STROBE Statement is being endorsed by a growing number of biomedical journals.
    Incomplete and inadequate reporting of research hampers the assessment of the
    strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the medical literature. Readers
    need to know what was planned (and what was not), what was done, what was found,
    and what the results mean. Recommendations on the reporting of studies that are
    endorsed by leading medical journals can improve the quality of reporting.Observational
    research comprises several study designs and many topic areas. We aimed to establish
    a checklist of items that should be included in articles reporting such research
    - the STROBE Statement. We considered it reasonable to initially restrict the
    recommendations to the three main analytical designs that are used in observational
    research - cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We want to provide
    guidance on how to report observational research well. Our recommendations are
    not prescriptions for designing or conducting studies. Also, the checklist is
    not an instrument to evaluate the quality of observational research.

  purpose_detail: Systems Biology has benefited tremendously from the development
    and use of SBML, which is a markup language to specify models composed of molecular
    species, and their interactions (including reactions). SBML is a common format
    that many systems biology software understand and thus it has become the way in
    which models are shared and communicated. Despite the popularity of SBML, that
    has resulted in many models being available in electronic format, there is currently
    no standard way of communicating the results of the operations carried out with
    such models (e.g. simulations). Here we propose a new markup language which is
    complementary to SBML and which is intended to specify results from operations
    carried out on models SBRML. In fact, this markup language is useful also to communicate
    experimental data as long as it is possible to express the data in terms of a
    reference SBML model. Thus SBRML is a means of specifying quantitative results
    in the context of a systems biology model.

  purpose_detail: The development of an abstract model for a taxonomic concept, which
    can capture the various models represented and understood by the various data
    providers, is central to this project. This model is presented as an XML schema
    document that is proposed as a standard to allow exchange of data between different
    data models. It aims to capture data as understood by the data owners without
    distortion, and facilitate the query of different data resources according to
    the common schema model. The TCS schema was conceived to allow the representation
    of taxonomic concepts as defined in published taxonomic classifications, revisions
    and databases. As such, it specifies the structure for XML documents to be used
    for the transfer of defined concepts. Valid transfer documents may either explicitly
    detail the defining components of taxon concepts, transfer GUIDs referring to
    defined taxon concepts (if and when these are available) or a mixture of the two.

  purpose_detail: A Locus-specific Database (LSDB) describes the variants discovered
    on a single gene or members of a gene family and other related functional elements.
    LSDBs are curated by experts on their respective loci, and as such are typically
    the best resources of such information available. But LSDBs vary widely in format
    and completeness, making data integration and exchange among them difficult and
    time-consuming. To address these difficulties, the VarioML format has been developed
    for the full range of variation data use-cases, providing semantically well-defined
    components which can be easily composed to fit specific needs. Using VarioML,
    data owners can now efficiently enable the integration, federation, and exchange
    of their variant data. The discoverabiliaty, extensibility, and quality of variation
    data is immediately enhanced. Critical new avenues of research and knowledge discovery
    are opened, as data using the VarioML standard can be integrated with the global
    library of purely genetic data. VarioML is a central prerequisite for effective
    modelling of phenotype data and genotype-to-phenotype relationships. It removes
    the long-standing technical obstacles to the effective passing of variant data
    from discovery laboratories into the biomedical database world. Now all that is
    needed is the broad participation of the genotype-to-phenotype research community.

  purpose_detail: TDWG vocabularies are a collection of standardized terms and their
    definitions. Vocabulary standards differ from other Biodiversity Information Standards
    (TDWG) standards in that they are likely to change more often over time as they
    evolve to meet the changing needs of the biodiversity informatics community. These
    changes may be incremental, making it impractical to apply the full TDWG standards
    process to every change. The TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification details
    the categories of changes that can be made to a TDWG vocabulary standard, the
    mechanisms used to achieve those changes, and the entities that are responsible
    for shepherding those changes through the process.

    of this instrument was administered to 65 consecutive patients seen in the Voice
    Clinic at Henry Ford Hospital. The data were subjected to measures of internal
    consistency reliability and the initial 85-item version was reduced to a 30-item
    final version. This final version was administered to 63 consecutive patients
    on two occasions in an attempt to assess test-retest stability, which proved to
    be strong. The findings of the latter analysis demonstrated that a change between
    two administrations of 18 points represents a significant shift in psychosocial
    function.

  purpose_detail: FieldML is a declarative language for building hierarchical models
    represented by generalized mathematical fields. FieldML is developed as a data
    model and accompanying API. Find out more about the FieldML API, where to get
    the latest release and how to contribute to its development. FieldML is a declarative
    language for representing hierarchical models using generalized mathematical fields.
    FieldML can be used to represent the dynamic 3D geometry and solution fields from
    computational models of cells, tissues and organs. It enables model interchange
    for the bioengineering and general engineering analysis communities. Example uses
    are models of tissue structure, the distribution of proteins and other biochemical
    compounds, anatomical annotation, and other biological annotation.

    Instead of resolving directly to Web resources (documents, data, services, people,

    of resources to change over time without negatively affecting systems that depend
    on them. This capability provides continuity of references to network resources
    that may migrate from machine to machine for business, social or technical reasons.

    using HTTP as the transport mechanism. TAPIR's flexibility makes it suitable to
    both very simple service implementations where the provider only responds to a
    set of pre-defined queries, or more advanced implementations where the provider
    software can dynamically parse complex queries referencing output models supplied
    by the client.

    Language, informally OWL 2, is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with
    formally defined meaning. OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals,
    and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can
    be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves
    are primarily exchanged as RDF documents.

  purpose_detail: To overcome the hurdle of disparate data sources and repositories
    with heterogeneous data formats a metadata crosswalk was initiated, based on existing
    standards. FAIR Principles were included, as well as data format specifications.
    The metadata crosswalk is the foundation of data provision between a Medical Data
    Integration Center (MeDIC) and researchers, providing a selection of metadata
    information for research design and requests. Based on the crosswalk, metadata
    items were prioritized and categorized to demonstrate that not one single predefined
    standard meets all requirements of a MeDIC and only a maximum data set of metadata
    is suitable for use. The development of a convergence format including the maximum
    data set is the anticipated solution for an automated transformation of metadata
    in a MeDIC.

    into dense representations; and a second exploring extracted admission representations
    in a recurrent-based architecture, where patient trajectories are processed in
    sub-sequences using a sliding window mechanism.

  description: Towards Clinical Practice - Design and Implementation of Convolutional
    Neural Network-Based Assistive Diagnosis System for COVID-19 Case Detection from
    Chest X-Ray Images
  has_relevant_organization:
  - B2AI_ORG:25
  purpose_detail: One of the critical tools for early detection and subsequent evaluation
    of the incidence of lung diseases is chest radiography. This study presents a
    real-world implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based Carebot
    Covid app to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images. Our proposed model
    takes the form of a simple and intuitive application. Used CNN can be deployed
    as a STOW-RS prediction endpoint for direct implementation into DICOM viewers.

  purpose_detail: We converted UK Biobank data to OMOP CDM v. 5.3. We transformed
    participant research data on diseases collected at recruitment and electronic
    health records (EHR) from primary care, hospitalizations, cancer registrations,
    and mortality from providers in England, Scotland, and Wales. We performed syntactic
    and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk factors between source
    and transformed data.

  purpose_detail: fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with
    high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results
    in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components
    that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things
    without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This
    is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common
    underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms
    of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly
    by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility
    of the PyTorch library.
