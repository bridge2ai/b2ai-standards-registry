  description: This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial
    Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the
    NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated
    KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived
    NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells
    in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI
    output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready
    datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here
    will be augmented regularly through the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration
    of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and

  description: The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes
    Insights (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset
    to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)
    research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including
    salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand and affect
    the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been limited by a
    lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal datasets.
    The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset
    of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the
    US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender,
    and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit
    downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease
    trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from participants
    with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM). The long-term
    objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM, agnostic
    to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to reconstruct
    a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis).
    Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available.
    This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research that
    focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved
    at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation,
    analysis, and sharing and collaboration).

  description: The human voice contains complex acoustic markers which have been linked
    to important health conditions including dementia, mood disorders, and cancer.
    When viewed as a biomarker, voice is a promising characteristic to measure as
    it is simple to collect, cost-effective, and has broad clinical utility. Recent
    advances in artificial intelligence have provided techniques to extract previously
    unknown prognostically useful information from dense data elements such as images.
    The Bridge2AI-Voice project seeks to create an ethically sourced flagship dataset
    to enable future research in artificial intelligence and support critical insights
    into the use of voice as a biomarker of health. Here we present Bridge2AI-Voice,
    a comprehensive collection of data derived from voice recordings with corresponding
    clinical information. Bridge2AI-Voice v1.0, the initial release, provides 12,523
    recordings for 306 participants collected across five sites in North America.
    Participants were selected based on known conditions which manifest within the
    voice waveform including voice disorders, neurological disorders, mood disorders,
    and respiratory disorders. The initial release contains data considered low risk,
    including derivations such as spectrograms but not the original voice recordings.
    Detailed demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire data are also made
    available.

    ethically sourced, AI-ready data set to answer the grand challenge of improving
    recovery from acute illness. This collaboration spans 20 academic centers, of
    which 14 will contribute as Data Acquisition centers. Patient-focused efforts
    will determine the ethical and legal approaches to manage privacy and bias, while
    accounting for Social Determinants of Health. Unified standards will harmonize
    multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data. A visualization and annotation
    environment will label data with targets important for prediction. A comprehensive
    set of approaches will develop the skills and workforce for a next generation
    of diverse academic and community AI scientists. Federated access will enable
    sampling methods to ensure a balanced and diverse cohort. Collaborating with Bridge2AI
    and 3 other data generation projects, the CHoRUS Network will help us cross the
    Bridge2AI network together.

  description: Multi-Scale Integrated Cell data. Two central approaches for mapping
    cellular structure – protein fluorescent imaging and protein biophysical association
    – each generate extensive datasets but of distinct qualities and resolutions that
    are typically treated separately. The MuSIC map is designed to address this challenge,
    by integrating immunofluorescent images in the Human Protein Atlas with ongoing
    affinity purification experiments from the BioPlex resource. The result is a unified
    hierarchical map of eukaryotic cell architecture. In the MuSIC hierarchy, nodes
    represent systems and arrows indicate containment of the lower system by the upper.
    Node color indicates known (gold) or putative novel (purple) systems. The size
    of each circle is based on the number of proteins in the system. The relative
    height of each system in the layout is determined based on the predicted diameter
    of the system in MuSIC.
