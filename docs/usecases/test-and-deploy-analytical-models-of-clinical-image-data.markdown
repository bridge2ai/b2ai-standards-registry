**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:30

**Name:** Test and deploy analytical models of clinical image data.

**Description:** Given the availability of a model of clinical image data (as produced by [B2AI_USECASE:25](../usecases/develop-models-of-clinical-image-data.markdown)), testing and deploying the model generally involves creating a test data set, preprocessing the data by normalizing and converting it into a format that can be used by the model, evaluating the model's performance on the test set, then optimizing the model by re-training under different parameters or input data until the desired level of performance is achieved. There may be a need for converting the model to a format that can be used in a specific runtime environment or monitoring the model's performance in a production environment and making adjustments as needed. Deploying the analytical model may require consideration of validation, regulatory approval, ethics, and compliance with patient privacy laws.
