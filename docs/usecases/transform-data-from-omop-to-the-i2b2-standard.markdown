**Name:** Transform data from OMOP to the i2b2 standard.

**Description:** Transforming data from OMOP to the i2b2 standard involves converting the data from OMOP's schema to the i2b2 schema, which allows for the data to be more easily queried and analyzed using i2b2's tools and platforms. This involves mapping the data to equivalent concepts in the i2b2 schema, and may also involve cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure that it is in the correct format for use with i2b2.
