**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:21

**Name:** Assemble standards for integrated maps of human cell architecture.

**Description:** As per Qin et al. (2021) Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04115-9), imaging data and biophysical association data may be combined to develop measurements of protein distance within subcellular systems. When combined with other data (see [B2AI_USECASE:16](../usecases/link-cellular-objects-to-functions-through-associations-between-proteins-cell-structure-proximity-and-transcriptomics.markdown)) the result is a map of cell architecture. Some degree of standardization will be necessary among these maps, such that they may be combined while retaining consistent biologically-relevant observations.
