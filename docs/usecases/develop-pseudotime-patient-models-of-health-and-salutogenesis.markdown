**Name:** Develop pseudotime patient models of health and salutogenesis.

**Description:** As presented by the AI-READI GC, developing pseudotime patient models of health and salutogenesis hinges on the idea that health is a time-sensitive process, with various events contributing to a progression towards clinical outcomes in a chronological fashion. The exact amount of time between events may not be as important as their order and may therefore be abstracted.

**Category:** modeling
