**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:5

**Name:** Obtain patient data from laboratory analysis, including serological testing and urinalysis.

**Description:** Patient data from laboratory analysis typically includes results from tests that have been performed on samples taken from the patient, such as blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. Serological testing is a type of laboratory analysis that involves testing blood serum (the liquid part of blood) for the presence of various indicators of disease or health. Urinalysis is another common type of laboratory analysis that involves testing urine samples for various factors, such as the presence of bacteria, glucose, or other substances. Test results may or may not be derived from EHR data. Here, data includes records from mobile devices used to complement laboratory diagnostics, including continuous glucose monitoring.
