**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:28

**Name:** Develop cross-sectional AI models of relationships between diabetes severity, cognitive function, and presence of biomarkers.

**Description:** As presented by the AI-READI GC, this use case develops models capable of interpreting relationships between clinical observations of diabetes patients and their features, with a focus on cognitive function. This case does not depend upon availability of pseudotime models, unlike B2AI_USECASE:29.
