**Name:** Build a database of human voice samples and associations with biomarkers of health.

**Description:** Building a database of human voice samples and associations with biomarkers of health may begin with a secure database, either on-premise or based in cloud infrastructure. Data organization and labeling should support retrieval and analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to the data to identify patterns and associations between the voice samples and the biomarkers of health. Regularly updating the database with new data and re-analyzing the data could improve the accuracy and resolution of the predicted associations.
