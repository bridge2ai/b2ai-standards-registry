**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:15

**Name:** Produce artifacts that map identifiers between source and standardized data representations.

**Description:** The sets of identifiers shared between two or more data products serve as points of commonality between observations, but in practice, a desired level of interoperability may not be achievable without mapping some identifiers to equivalent terms. This may be necessary for entire namespaces (e.g., mapping all NCBI Gene identifiers to their corresponding UniProtKB protein accessions) or for a subset (e.g., mapping ChEBI entries for drugs to their identifiers in a drug-centric knowledge base). There may also be a need to define inexact matches: an identifierâ€™s best mapping in another resource may be to a more broadly-defined concept.
