**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:11

**Name:** Obtain proteome data from human cell samples.

**Description:** The proteome is the complete set of proteins that is expressed by a genome, cell, tissue, or organism at a given time and set of conditions. Proteome data refers to the information that is generated from studies of the proteome, such as the identification and characterization of the proteins that are expressed, their relative abundance, and any modifications that they may undergo. In the CM4AI project, proteome data is obtained through affinity purification coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy (AP-MS/MS).
