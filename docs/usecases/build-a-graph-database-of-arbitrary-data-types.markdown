**Name:** Build a graph database of arbitrary data types.

**Description:** To set up a graph database, first choose a graph database management system. Create a graph data model to define the nodes, edges, and properties of the graph. Once the data model is in place, create nodes, edges, and properties in the graph corresponding to input data. Depending on the graph database platform, there may be functionality to set up indexes on certain properties to optimize query performance. Setting up constraints on the data can help to ensure data integrity.
