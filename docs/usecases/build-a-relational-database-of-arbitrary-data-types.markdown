**Name:** Build a relational database of arbitrary data types.

**Description:** To set up a relational database, first choose a relational database management system (RDBMS). Create a schema to define the database structure, including the tables and fields. Build tables within the schema and define the fields and data types for each table, then populate them with data by inserting rows. It's also crucial to set up relationships between tables, such as linking a primary key in one table to a foreign key in another table. This ensures data integrity and simplifies querying.
