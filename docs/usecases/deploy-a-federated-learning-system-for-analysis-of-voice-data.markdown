**Name:** Deploy a Federated Learning System for analysis of voice data.

**Description:** As presented by the Voice GC, a set of patient voice recordings may be analyzed in an automated manner through the machine learning approach of federated learning. In federated learning, a central model is first trained on a dataset distributed among many devices or clients. Individual clients train their own copies of the model on their own data, then send updated model parameters to the central server. The server then averages newly updated parameters from all clients to produce a new global model. It returns the new model to the clients and the process repeats.
