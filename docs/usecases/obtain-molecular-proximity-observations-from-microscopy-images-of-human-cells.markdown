**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:10

**Name:** Obtain molecular proximity observations from microscopy images of human cells.

**Description:** Images of objects at the microscale (i.e., those at 0.1–100μm) are obtained through a variety of microscopy approaches. In the CM4AI project, images of cell structures are obtained through confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.

**Category:** acquisition

**Involved in:** Experimental Design, Metadata Management

**Data Topics:**
