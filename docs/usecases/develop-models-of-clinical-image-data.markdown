**Name:** Develop models of clinical image data.

**Description:** Developing models of clinical image data may involve annotation, preprocessing, and model training. Generally, annotation requires labeling  images with disease or clinical phenotype-relevant information such as labels, bounding boxes, and segmentation masks. The annotation process may be assisted by automated methods, particularly in cases where patient features are already known. Preprocessing such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation then prepares the labeled images for model training. The training process applies machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from the data and make predictions on new images.
