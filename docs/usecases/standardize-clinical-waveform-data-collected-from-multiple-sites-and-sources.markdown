**Name:** Standardize clinical waveform data collected from multiple sites and sources.

**Description:** As with other clinical observations and records, standardizing waveform data is largely a process of collection, cleaning, transformation, validation, and storage. The features of waveforms, whether audio or cardiac in origin, require specific handling to ensure physiologically-relevant details are retained. Raw waveform data is quite large and therefore consumes more disk space than most database architectures are prepared to operate with. This data may be collected continuously, leading to accumulation of large quantities of incoming observations to store and analyze. standardization must therefore be sensitive to the size and resolution of waveform data.
