**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:17

**Name:** Standardize clinical record data collected from multiple sites and sources.

**Description:** Standardizing clinical record data across multiple sites and sources involves several steps, all with the goal of rendering it more usable in subsequent analyses. Data is first collected from electronic health records, clinical databases, surveys, and potentially other sources. Next, the data is cleaned and transformed to a consistent format. This may include removing duplicate records, filling in missing data, and standardizing field names and values. The data is then validated to ensure that it is accurate and complete. Standardized data is then integrated into a central repository.

**Category:** standardization
