**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:6

**Name:** Obtain patient data from wearable devices.

**Description:** Wearable devices are small electronic devices that can be worn on the body to collect data about the user's activity, movements, and other physiological information. This data can include things like steps taken, heart rate, sleep patterns, and other metrics that can be used to track health and fitness. Activity data may be viewed in aggregate (e.g., number of steps per day above a threshold rather than exact counts or geolocation data) to serve as approximates of physical fitness assessments otherwise performed by clinical personnel.

**Category:** acquisition
