**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:24

**Name:** Develop multi-scale maps of human cell architecture.

**Description:** Given the availability of integrated imaging, biophysical, and transcriptome data centered on a specific set of proteins (see [B2AI_USECASE:16](../usecases/link-cellular-objects-to-functions-through-associations-between-proteins-cell-structure-proximity-and-transcriptomics.markdown)), we may then use these results to assemble maps of the physical proximities and relationships among those proteins.

**Category:** modeling

**Involved in:** Experimental Design, Metadata Management

**Data Topics:**

- [B2AI_TOPIC:19](../topics/MicroscaleImaging.markdown)

- [B2AI_TOPIC:27](../topics/ProteinStructureModel.markdown)
