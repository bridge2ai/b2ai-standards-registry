**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:24

**Name:** Develop multi-scale maps of human cell architecture.

**Description:** Given the availability of integrated imaging, biophysical, and transcriptome data centered on a specific set of proteins (see B2AI_USECASE:16), we may then use these results to assemble maps of the physical proximities and relationships among those proteins.

**Category:** modeling

**Involved in:** Experimental Design, Metadata Management

**Data Topics:**

- B2AI_TOPIC:19
