**Name:** Link cellular objects to functions through associations between proteins, cell structure proximity, and transcriptomics.

**Description:** As per Qin et al. (2021) Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04115-9), imaging data and biophysical association data may be combined to develop measurements of protein distance within subcellular systems. This use case builds on that strategy by adding a third component: measurement of transcript changes under perturbation conditions for each protein. For the CM4AI GC, this process involves evidence graphs. The result here is not a full subcellular map, but rather the integrated data necessary to assemble such a map.
