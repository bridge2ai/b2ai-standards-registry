**Name:** Construct standards for computational provenance.

**Description:** Computational provenance is a record of the processes and data used to produce a computational result. Constructing standards for computational provenance involves establishing protocols for how this information should be recorded, stored, and shared. This can include what information provenance records must contain, their format(s), and any connections to the resulting computation. Additionally, standards may be established for how provenance should be validated and authenticated to ensure its accuracy and trustworthiness.
