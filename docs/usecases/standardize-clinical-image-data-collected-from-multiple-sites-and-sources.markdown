**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:19

**Name:** Standardize clinical image data collected from multiple sites and sources.

**Description:** Standardizing clinical images across sites and sources involves ensuring that images are captured and stored in a consistent manner, so that they can be easily compared and analyzed. This may include following guidelines for image acquisition, e.g., recommended image resolution, contrast, and lighting conditions. It also includes image metadata properties such as consistent labeling and format. Depending on subsequent applications, it may require image processing, such as normalization, to correct for variations in appearance due to differences in equipment or patient positioning.

**Category:** standardization
