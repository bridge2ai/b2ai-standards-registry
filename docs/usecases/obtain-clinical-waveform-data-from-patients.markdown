**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:3

**Name:** Obtain clinical waveform data from patients.

**Description:** Clinical waveform data from an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a representation of the electrical activity of the heart. The EKG measures the voltage between different points on the body and records the resulting waveform. This waveform can be used to diagnose a variety of heart conditions, including arrhythmias and heart attacks. It is typically recorded using a machine that is attached to the patient via electrodes.
