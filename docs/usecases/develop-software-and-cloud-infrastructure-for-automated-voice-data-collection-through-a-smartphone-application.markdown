**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:31

**Name:** Develop software and cloud infrastructure for automated voice data collection through a smartphone application.

**Description:** Developing software and cloud infrastructure for automated voice data collection in this use case first requires development of a smartphone application. The application would need to be able to record audio, allow user logins, upload the recorded audio to cloud storage, and permit users to view and manage recorded audio data. The cloud infrastructure would need to store and process the audio data to handle the storage, as well as potentially using machine learning algorithms to analyze the audio data. Additionally, the infrastructure would need to have a secure and reliable means of transmitting data between the smartphone application and the cloud.
