**Name:** Obtain social determinants of health data from patients.

**Description:** Social determinants of health (SDoH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. These conditions are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. SDoH are largely responsible for health inequities - unfair and avoidable differences in health status from person to person. SDoH data may be collected directly from individuals or based on integration with other data, but it generally includes at least one of the following factors poverty and income inequality, education and literacy, employment and working conditions, gender and gender equality, social exclusion and discrimination, housing and living conditions, or access to healthcare.
