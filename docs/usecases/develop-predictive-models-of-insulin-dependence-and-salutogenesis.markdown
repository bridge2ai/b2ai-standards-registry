**ID:** B2AI_USECASE:29

**Name:** Develop predictive models of insulin dependence and salutogenesis.

**Description:** As presented by the AI-READI GC, this use case develops models capable of interpreting relationships between clinical observations of diabetes patients and their features, with a focus on insulin dependence. Its goal is to produce a model capable of yielding predictions about a given patientâ€™s progression towards a health or disease state. This case depends upon availability of pseudotime models, unlike B2AI_USECASE:28.
