# Organizations in the Bridge2AI Standards Explorer

Organizations represented with entries in the Explorer are those using, managing, creating, and/or governing one or more data standards.

All Organization identifiers have the prefix `B2AI_ORG`.

These include the Bridge2AI Grand Challenges described below:

Where possible, organizations are accompanied by the following identifiers:

* A URL to a page providing more details about the organization.

* An identifier from the [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/). These begin with the prefix `ror`. They may be resolved as a URL by appending the identifier to `https://ror.org`. For example, <https://ror.org/02z468g17> leads to the ROR page for the Internet Archive.

* An identifier from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). These begin with the prefix `wikidata`. They may be resolved as a URL by appending the identifier to `https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/`. For example, <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15028> leads to the Wikidata page for the International Organization for Standardization.
