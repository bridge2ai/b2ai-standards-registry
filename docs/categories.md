# Categories in the Bridge2AI Standards Explorer

The Bridge2AI Standards Explorer categorizes data standards and tools into several categories. Each category represents a specific type of standard or tool with its own unique characteristics and purposes.

## Data Standard or Tool Classes

### Data Standard or Tool
The base class for all standards and tools in the Explorer. In practice, no resource will have this category, but will be assigned one of the categories below.

**Each standard or tool may:**
* Be associated with data topics
* Have relevant organizations
* Have training resources
* Include details like openness status, registration requirements, URLs, and publications

### Data Standard
A general purpose data. This represents specifications, schemas, or guidelines for data management. It may not have been developed specifically for biomedical or biological research data, but is relevant to data science more broadly or has been adopted for specific research purposes.

### Biomedical Standard
A specialized standard with particular applications or relevance to clinical or biomedical research purposes. These standards address the unique needs of biomedical data.

### Registry
A resource that serves to curate and/or index other resources. Registries provide a centralized location to discover and access other standards or tools.

### Ontology Or Vocabulary
A set of concepts and categories, potentially defined or accompanied by their hierarchical relationships. These provide standardized terminologies and semantics for consistent data annotation.

### Model Repository
A resource serving to curate and store computational models. Unlike registries that may only index models, a model repository must provide storage functionality, such that users can retrieve the models for their own use.

### Reference Data Or Dataset
A standardized, reusable data source. These resources provide benchmark or canonical data that can be used across multiple research projects.

### Software Or Tool
A piece of software or computational tool. These resources provide implementations of algorithms, analysis methods, or other computational capabilities. They may not have been developed explicitly for biomedical or biological research.

### Reference Implementation
An implementation of one or more standards or tools, whether as a full specification in a particular language or as an application to a specific use case. These demonstrate how to properly implement standards or use tools. These implementations may not have their own names and in these cases are referred to with a name based on their corresponding publication (e.g., [B2AI_STANDARD:687](https://b2ai.standards.synapse.org/Explore/Standard/DetailsPage?id=B2AI_STANDARD:687) is Gupta2021).

### Training Program
A program for developing skills and experience related to standards or tools. These resources help users learn how to effectively apply standards or use tools.

## Classification Tags

Standards and tools can be tagged with specific collection tags to further categorize them. Some of the available tags include:

- **audiovisual**: Audiovisual standards
- **fileformat**: File format standards
- **toolkit**: Bioinformatics toolkits
- **clinicaldata**: Clinical data standards
- **multimodal**: Standards for multimodal data integration
- **text**: Text data standards and data sets
- **cloudplatform**: Cloud research platforms
- **datamodel**: Data models
- **dataregistry**: Data registries
- **datavisualization**: Data visualization tools
- **machinelearningframework**: Machine learning frameworks
- **eyedata**: Eye data sets
- **proteindata**: Protein data sets
- **referencegenome**: Reference genome data
- **scrnaseqanalysis**: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis tools
- **speechdata**: Speech data sets

*Note: This is not an exhaustive list of all available tags.*

## Relationships Between Standards and Topics

Standards and tools in the registry can be related to specific data topics and organizations. These relationships help users identify relevant standards for their specific data domains and connect with responsible organizations. See the page on [topics](topics.md) for more details.
