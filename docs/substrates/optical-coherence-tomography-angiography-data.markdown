**name:** Optical coherence tomography angiography data

**description:** Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light waves to create high-resolution images of blood flow in the retina and choroid, offering a detailed view of the eye's microvasculature without the need for dye injection. OCTA data is used in ophthalmology to diagnose and monitor eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration.
