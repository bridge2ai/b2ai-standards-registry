**name:** Spectral Data

**description:** Spectral data contains information about the intensity or strength of different frequencies or wavelengths of some type of energy, including light or other electromagnetic radiation. It may be a representation of the composition and properties of materials or signals. It may be obtained by transforming waveforms (i.e., data in the time domain) into the frequency domain with a Fourier transform or other method.
