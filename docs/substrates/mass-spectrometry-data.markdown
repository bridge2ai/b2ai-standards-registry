**name:** Mass Spectrometry Data

**description:** Mass spectrometry data, also referred to as a mass spectrum, is a representation of the mass to charge (m/z) ratios of the ions present in a sample plotted against their intensities. Each peak in a mass spectrum shows a component of unique m/z in the sample, and heights of the peaks connote the relative abundance of the various components in the sample.
