Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated. Version 1.2 is currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and BioCASE (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe) networks. Apart from the GBIF and BioCASE networks, the potential for the application of ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible).

CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules, reactions, solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a special flexible approach to numeric science it also covers a very wide range of chemical properties, parameters and experimental observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been heavily informed by the current chemical scholarly literature and chemical databases. XML is a mainstream approach providing semantics for science, such as MathML, SBML/BIOPAX (biology), GML and KML (geo) SVG (graphics) and NLM-DTD, ODT and OOXML (documents). CML provides support for most chemistry, especially molecules, compounds, reactions, spectra, crystals and computational chemistry (compchem). CML has been developed by Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa since 1995. It is the de facto XML for chemistry, accepted by publishers and with more than 1 million lines of Open Source code supporting it. CML can be validated and built into authoring tools (for example the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Word). A list of CML-compliant and CML-aware software can be found on the software page. The infrastructure includes legacy converters, dictionaries and conventions, Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. There are several versions of the CML schema. The most recent schema is schema 3. This essentially relaxes many of the constraints imposed in the previous stable release (schema 2.4), allowing users to put together the elements and attributes in a more flexible manner to fit the data that they want to represent more easily.","[""markuplanguage""]","No","No","[""B2AI_TOPIC:3""]",,,"Yes","No","https://www.xml-cml.org/",,,,,,,"No","[""Cheminformatics""]",,,

Therefore all the information is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors, peer reviewers, journals and readers.

It is imperative that we attempt to understand the reasons why multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses, patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis methods. In addition, the guidelines provide helpful suggestions on how to present data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and understand the context in which the conclusions apply.","[""guidelines""]","No","No","[""B2AI_TOPIC:5""]",,,"Yes","No","https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/reporting-recommendations-for-tumour-marker-prognostic-studies-remark/","https://www.equator-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REMARK-checklist-for-EQUATOR-website-002.docx","doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6602678",,,,,"No","[""Data""]",,,

Incomplete and inadequate reporting of research hampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the medical literature.

Recommendations on the reporting of studies that are endorsed by leading medical journals can improve the quality of reporting.Observational research comprises several study designs and many topic areas. We aimed to establish a checklist of items that should be included in articles reporting such research - the STROBE Statement. We considered it reasonable to initially restrict the recommendations to the three main analytical designs that are used in observational research - cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.

Here we propose a new markup language which is complementary to SBML and which is intended to specify results from operations carried out on models SBRML.

Together, these enable researchers to use health-related attributes of the regions where patients live in OHDSI study cohort definitions. For example, you can use the GIS toolchain to define cohorts that include regional data on exposure to toxicants or social deprivation along with EHR data on relevant health outcomes. The toolchain also includes informatics resources that support integration with the main OHDSI tool stack (HADES) and integration with externally supported solutions for geocoding and for finding and deriving relevant data sources from catalogs of available data sources. Importantly, the toolchain allows integrated analysis of geospatial and EHR data without sharing any sensitive patient location data.","[""datamodel"", ""has_ai_application"", ""standards_process_maturity_final"", ""implementation_maturity_production""]","Yes","Yes","[""B2AI_TOPIC:14""]","[""B2AI_ORG:76"", ""B2AI_ORG:115""]",,"Yes","No","https://ohdsi.github.io/GIS/",,,,,,,"Yes","[""Geolocation""]","[""OHDSI"", ""AI/ML for Clinical Care Grand Challenge""]",,
"B2AI_STANDARD:897","MI-CDM","Medical Imaging Common Data Model","Biomedical Standard","The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques require access to large inter-institutional cohorts of data to enable the development of robust models, e.g., targeting the identification of disease biomarkers and quantifying disease progression and treatment efficacy. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) has been designed to accommodate a harmonized representation of observational healthcare data. This study proposes the Medical Imaging CDM (MI-CDM) extension, adding two new tables and two vocabularies to the OMOP CDM to address the structural and semantic requirements to support imaging research. The tables provide the capabilities of linking DICOM data sources as well as tracking the provenance of imaging features derived from those images. The implementation of the extension enables phenotype definitions using imaging features and expanding standardized computable imaging biomarkers. This proposal offers a comprehensive and unified approach for conducting imaging research and outcome studies utilizing imaging features.","[""datamodel"", ""has_ai_application"", ""standards_process_maturity_development"", ""implementation_maturity_pilot""]","Yes","No","[""B2AI_TOPIC:4""]","[""B2AI_ORG:76"", ""B2AI_ORG:115""]",,"Yes","No",,,"doi:10.1007/s10278-024-00982-6",,,,"[""B2AI_STANDARD:98"", ""B2AI_STANDARD:243""]","Yes","[""Clinical Observations""]","[""OHDSI"", ""AI/ML for Clinical Care Grand Challenge""]",,
