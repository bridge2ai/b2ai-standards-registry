# Bridge2AI Standards Registry and Use Case Catalog

This is the Bridge2AI Standards Registry, a collection of data standards used in biomedical research and data science, with an emphasis on standards used to prepare data for artificial intelligence-driven applications.

⚠ [Please use this form to suggest an addition.](https://github.com/bridge2ai/b2ai-standards-registry/issues/new?template=newEntity.yml)

## Purpose

This Registry is assembled as part of the [Bridge2AI program](https://bridge2ai.org/). Its overall purpose is to support generation of standardized, interoperable, and machine-readable data from biomedical research.

The standards in the registry fall into three categories:

1. Standards for structuring data used for testing, training, and validating AI models (e.g., genomics file formats and standards for EHR data such as FHIR, OMOP, and ISO).
2. Standards for describing specific datasets (i.e., standard computable elements associated with specific data types for use in Datasheets<sup>1</sup>).
3. Standards for describing machine learning models themselves (i.e., standard computable elements associated with specific ML models for use in Model Cards<sup>2</sup>).

Where possible, existing standards (e.g., minimal information specifications<sup>3-5</sup>) are used to inform data element selection. The Registry also includes records for standards outside the scope of data modeling, such as specifications for preferred file formats, exchange protocols, and common APIs.

Our Standards Registry goals are threefold:

1. Ensure integration of the standards development lifecycle within the context of B2AI activities.
2. Narrow the large space of standards to what is relevant.
3. Provide computational access and utilities for schemas and standards, rather than links to often outdated PDFs.

## Repository Structure

* [docs](docs/) - Project documentation
* [project](project/)
  * [data](project/data) - Generated data serializations.
* [src/](src/) - source files
  * [schema](src/schema) - a copy of the standards-schemas - see https://github.com/bridge2ai/standards-schemas
  * [data](src/data) - Data in YAML format

## User Documentation

### Quick Reference

The Standards Registry contains three main components: the list of standards and tools, the list of use cases, and the collection of associated metadata types (spanning organizations, data topics, and data substrates).

For a quick overview of each of these components, see the documentation pages here: https://bridge2ai.github.io/b2ai-standards-registry/

You may also reference the following tab-delimited files:

| Component | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Standards Registry          | [DataStandardOrTool.tsv](project/data/DataStandardOrTool.tsv)         |
| Use Cases                   | [UseCase.tsv](project/data/UseCase.tsv)                               |
| Data Substrates             | [DataSubstrates.tsv](project/data/DataSubstrate.tsv)                  |
| Data Topics                 | [DataTopic.tsv](project/data/DataTopic.tsv)                           |

### Submitting a New Standard

To submit a new data standard or other entry to the Registry (including data topics, organizations, or others), please open an issue on this repository using this form: https://github.com/bridge2ai/b2ai-standards-registry/issues/new?template=newEntity.yml

## Developer Documentation

### Data Model

Data objects are defined according to the [standards-schemas](https://github.com/bridge2ai/standards-schemas).

### Requirements

#### Bash

This project requires **GNU Make** and **Bash**. Ensure you have a recent version of Bash installed:

* **Linux**: Bash is usually pre-installed
* **macOS**: The system default Bash (`/bin/bash`) is an older version (3.2). To use newer features, install a recent version via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install bash
```

* **Windows**: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Git Bash to run Make commands.

**Minimum Bash Version:** This project requires **Bash 4.0 or later** due to its use of associative arrays. Check your version with:

```sh
bash --version
```

If you encounter issues, ensure your system is using the correct version of Bash.

#### Poetry

You must install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

`poetry install`: initiate poetry environment for development and build environment

#### Pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#usage>) to run conformance tests before
commits. This provides checks for:

* Code format and style
* Added large files

Before your first commit, run:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

### Project Generation

Use the `make` command to generate project artifacts:

* `make all`: make everything
* `make update-schemas`: update the standards-schemas
* `make all-data`: make data serializations
* `make test`: test the validators
* `make validate`: validate the data
* `make site`: prepare data documentation site
* `make deploy`: deploys site

### Data Model Workflow

In order to update the schema, you must first do this in the
[standards-schemas](https://github.com/bridge2ai/standards-schemas).

Once this work is merged into the `main` branch, you should run the following:

```shell
make update-schemas
```

This will update the source yaml files in [src/schema](./src/schema/).

Afterwards, you will be able to modify the source yaml files in [src/data](./src/data/).

## Accessing Registry Data

Please see the [src/data](src/data) directory for data in YAML format or the [project/data](project/data) directory for other formats.
