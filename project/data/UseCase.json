This typically includes taking a detailed medical history, conducting a physical examination, ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests, and documenting the findings in the patient's medical record. This may also include more focused evaluations, as with the AI-READI project’s assessments of cognitive function and visual acuity. Medical records may include structured/unstructured text, values for lab results, and/or images.",

      "description": "Developing software and cloud infrastructure for automated voice data collection in this use case first requires development of a smartphone application. The application would need to be able to record audio, allow user logins, upload the recorded audio to cloud storage, and permit users to view and manage recorded audio data. The cloud infrastructure would need to store and process the audio data to handle the storage, as well as potentially using machine learning algorithms to analyze the audio data. Additionally, the infrastructure would need to have a secure and reliable means of transmitting data between the smartphone application and the cloud.",
