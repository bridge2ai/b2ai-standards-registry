      title: "CRISPR Perturbation Cell Atlas"
      description: "This dataset represents an expressed genome-scale CRISPRi Perturbation Cell Atlas in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) mapping transcriptional and fitness phenotypes associated with 11,739 targeted genes, as part of the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org) Functional Genomics Grand Challenge, a component of the U.S. National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Bridge2AI program. We validated these findings via phenotypic, protein-interaction, and metabolic tracing assays."

      title: "Protein Localization Subcellular Images - Paclitaxel"
      description: "This data set displays the spatial localization of 563 proteins of interest in cells of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 treated with paclitaxel as imaged by immunofluorescence-based staining (ICC-IF) and confocal microscopy in the Lundberg Lab at Stanford University, as part of the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org) project. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue channel); endoplasmic reticulum with a calreticulin antibody (yellow channel); microtubules with tubulin antibody (red channel); and antibody against protein of interest (green channel)."

      description: "This data set displays the spatial localization of 563 proteins of interest in untreated cells of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 as imaged by immunofluorescence-based staining (ICC-IF) and confocal microscopy in the Lundberg Lab at Stanford University, as part of the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org) project. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue channel); endoplasmic reticulum with a calreticulin antibody (yellow channel); microtubules with tubulin antibody (red channel); and antibody against protein of interest (green channel)."

      description: "This data set displays the spatial localization of 563 proteins of interest in cells of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 treated with vorinostat as imaged by immunofluorescence-based staining (ICC-IF) and confocal microscopy in the Lundberg Lab at Stanford University, as part of the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org) project. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue channel); endoplasmic reticulum with a calreticulin antibody (yellow channel); microtubules with tubulin antibody (red channel); and antibody against protein of interest (green channel)."
