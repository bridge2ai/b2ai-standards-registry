      title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
      description: "Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 contains data for 19,271 recordings collected from 442 participants across five sites in North America. Participants were selected based on known conditions which manifest within the voice waveform including voice disorders, neurological disorders, mood disorders, and respiratory disorders. The release contains data considered low risk, including derivations such as spectrograms but not the original voice recordings. Detailed demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire data are also made available."
