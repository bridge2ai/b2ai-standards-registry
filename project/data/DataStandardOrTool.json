The format uses zero-based coordinates for the first sequence and supports alignments on either strand, with sequences from the negative strand reverse-complemented. Axt files are particularly useful for representing whole-genome alignments between species (such as human-mouse or human-chimp comparisons) generated by alignment tools like BLASTZ or LASTZ. The format's straightforward structure makes it easy to parse programmatically and convert to other formats. UCSC provides utilities including axtToMaf for converting to MAF (Multiple Alignment Format), axtChain for chaining together alignments, and axtBest for selecting the best alignment for each position. While Axt efficiently represents pairwise alignments, it has been largely superseded by MAF and chain/net formats for more complex multi-way alignments and hierarchical alignment representations in comparative genomics workflows.",

BigBed files store annotation items representing either simple genomic features or linked collections of exons, maintaining BED semantics while enabling efficient region-specific data transfer. Files are created using the bedToBigBed utility which converts sorted BED files into compressed binary format with built-in indexing, requiring chromosome sizes files and optionally AutoSql (.as) format definitions for describing standard and custom fields. The format supports BED3 through BED12 plus additional user-defined fields, with features including itemRgb color specification, extra searchable indices via the -extraIndex parameter for track hub item searches, and trackDb settings for mouseOver labels, field filtering, and URL transformations. Only the portions of bigBed files needed for the currently displayed chromosomal region are transferred to the browser, dramatically improving performance compared to full BED file loading. The format supports web-accessible hosting via HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP with sparse file caching, and includes utilities (bigBedToBed, bigBedInfo, bigBedSummary) for extracting and querying data. BigBed files are widely used in UCSC Genome Browser custom tracks, track hubs for consortia data sharing, and integrated with genome analysis workflows requiring scalable annotation storage and rapid genomic region queries.",

CRAM (currently version 3.x) achieves superior compression ratios by storing differences from a reference sequence rather than full sequence data, using custom compression codecs detailed in the CRAMcodecs specification. Both formats support indexing (BAI for BAM, CRAI for CRAM, and CSI as a more scalable successor) enabling rapid random access to genomic regions. The formats are widely supported by genomics toolkits including samtools, htslib, htsjdk, and GATK, with standard operations for sorting, merging, filtering, and format conversion. CRAM offers significant storage savings particularly important for large-scale projects, while maintaining full compatibility with SAM/BAM workflows.

Each BEL assertion is packaged as a \"nanopub\" that includes provenance information, experimental conditions, and citations, allowing relationships to be properly evaluated in context. The language supports standard biological nomenclatures (Gene Ontology, HGNC, ChEBI, etc.) through namespace integration and provides a simplified syntax that is more accessible than traditional chemical notation.

The format consists of 12 possible fields, with the first three (chromosome, start position, end position) being mandatory and nine additional optional fields providing detailed feature information including name, score, strand orientation, thick start/end coordinates for coding regions, RGB color values for visualization, and block structures for representing discontinuous features like exons and introns. BED files use zero-based, half-open coordinate system where the start position is inclusive and the end position is exclusive, enabling precise genomic interval representation. The format supports various annotation types from simple genomic intervals to complex gene models, making it essential for genomic data visualization, comparative genomics, and functional annotation workflows in bioinformatics research.",

The 1999 FDA electronic submission (eSub) guidance and the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) documents specify that a document describing the content and structure of the included data should be provided within a submission. This document is known as the Data Definition Document (e.g., define.pdf in the 1999 guidance).

The standard specifies field names, labels, prompt questions, and controlled terminology for capturing clinical observations, ensuring that data can be directly traced to the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) without extensive post-collection transformation. By harmonizing data collection at the source, CDASH reduces data cleaning efforts, improves data quality, and accelerates the transition from collection to analysis. The standard covers various therapeutic areas and data domains including demographics, vital signs, adverse events, concomitant medications, and laboratory results. CDISC provides a library of ready-to-use, CDASH-compliant annotated eCRFs in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, XML) that can be implemented as-is or customized for specific study needs, facilitating regulatory submission and data review processes.",

Each chain alignment consists of a header line specifying score, chromosome identifiers, sizes, strands, and coordinates for both sequences, followed by alignment data lines describing ungapped blocks and the gaps between them. The format uses zero-based half-open intervals for coordinates and includes support for reverse-complement alignments through strand indicators. Chain files are particularly useful for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions, representing syntenic relationships, structural variations, and evolutionary rearrangements. They are commonly used in genome browsers and liftOver tools for mapping genomic coordinates between different genome assemblies or between species. The format supports \"snake\" or rearrangement display modes that visualize complex structural variants including inversions, duplications, and translocations. Chain alignments can be produced by tools like BLASTZ and are widely used in comparative genomics workflows.",

      "purpose_detail": "CML (Chemical Markup Language) is an XML language designed to hold most of the central concepts in chemistry. It was the first language to be developed and plays the same role for chemistry as MathML for mathematics and GML for geographical systems. CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules, reactions, solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a special flexible approach to numeric science it also covers a very wide range of chemical properties, parameters and experimental observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been heavily informed by the current chemical scholarly literature and chemical databases. XML is a mainstream approach providing semantics for science, such as MathML, SBML/BIOPAX (biology), GML and KML (geo) SVG (graphics) and NLM-DTD, ODT and OOXML (documents). CML provides support for most chemistry, especially molecules, compounds, reactions, spectra, crystals and computational chemistry (compchem). CML has been developed by Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa since 1995. It is the de facto XML for chemistry, accepted by publishers and with more than 1 million lines of Open Source code supporting it. CML can be validated and built into authoring tools (for example the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Word). A list of CML-compliant and CML-aware software can be found on the software page. The infrastructure includes legacy converters, dictionaries and conventions, Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. There are several versions of the CML schema. The most recent schema is schema 3. This essentially relaxes many of the constraints imposed in the previous stable release (schema 2.4), allowing users to put together the elements and attributes in a more flexible manner to fit the data that they want to represent more easily.",

The CONSORT 2025 Statement consists of a 30-item checklist and flow diagram covering how trials are designed, analyzed, and interpreted, with detailed recommendations for reporting participant recruitment, randomization procedures, interventions, outcomes, sample size calculations, statistical methods, baseline characteristics, results for each outcome, harms, interpretation, and generalizability. The flow diagram tracks progress of all participants through each trial stage (enrollment, allocation, follow-up, analysis) with numbers and reasons for exclusions and losses. CONSORT is companion to SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items - Recommendations for Interventional Trials) which provides a 34-item checklist for protocol reporting. Both guidelines emphasize transparent and complete reporting to enable readers to critically appraise, interpret, and apply research findings. CONSORT includes numerous extensions for specific trial designs (cluster randomized, non-inferiority, pragmatic trials), interventions (herbal, acupuncture, non-pharmacological treatment), and data types. The guidelines are supported by Explanation and Elaboration documents with detailed rationale and examples, online tools (COBWEB for report writing, SEPTRE for protocol management), translations in multiple languages, and endorsement by hundreds of medical journals worldwide as part of the EQUATOR Network research reporting standards.",

It uses modern cryptographic standards including Curve25519 for key agreement, ChaCha20 for encryption, and Poly1305 for authentication. The format supports multiple recipients through per-recipient encrypted headers, enabling controlled data sharing where different users can decrypt the same file using their own private keys. Crypt4GH is designed for streaming access, allowing applications to decrypt and process data incrementally without loading entire files into memory. The format includes metadata protection and supports selective decryption of file segments, making it suitable for large-scale genomic datasets. Existing bioinformatics tools can be adapted with minimal modifications to read and write Crypt4GH-encrypted data, facilitating adoption in genomics workflows.",

This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data. Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.",

Users and potential users of the standard include economic botanists and ethnobotanists whose purpose is to record all known information about the uses of a taxon; educationalists, taxonomists, biochemists, anatomists etc. who wish to record plant use, often at a broad level; economic botany collection curators who need to describe accurately the uses and values of specimens in their collections; bibliographers who need to describe plant uses referred to in publications and to apply keywords consistently for ease of data retrieval. While this standard is still in use, it is no longer actively maintained (labelled as prior on the TDWG website).",

The format is hardware and software independent, supporting various montages, transducers, prefiltering options, and sampling frequencies. EDF enables creation of common databases for sleep records, comparative analysis of algorithms across laboratories, and standardized evaluation of manual and automatic analysis methods. The format has been extended to EDF+, which maintains backward compatibility while adding support for interrupted recordings, annotations, stimuli, events, and analysis results such as deltaplots, QRS parameters, and sleep stages. EDF+ can store any medical recording including EMG, evoked potentials, and ECG data, with stricter specifications that enable automatic electrode localization and calibration. Both formats are freely available and widely adopted in commercial equipment and multicenter research projects.",

Based on the W3C Provenance specification, it establishes a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility in healthcare data systems. The resource supports three key components from W3C Provenance: Entity (physical, digital, or conceptual things with fixed aspects), Agent (persons, devices, systems, organizations, or care teams bearing responsibility for activities), and Activity (time-bound processes that act upon entities). Provenance resources serve as record-keeping assertions that capture context information for quality, reliability, and trustworthiness assessments. The standard supports multiple use cases including tracking data lineage in clinical workflows, enabling audit trails for regulatory compliance, supporting clinical decision-making through data origin verification, and facilitating data integration from multiple healthcare systems. It includes digital signature capabilities for integrity verification and non-repudiation, supports versioning and unique identification requirements, and provides mechanisms for recording import and transformation activities in healthcare interoperability scenarios.\"",

An initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer was generated by open-ended interviews with patients experienced with the symptoms of cancer and oncology professionals. Using preselected criteria, items were reduced to a 38-item general version. Factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on 545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G). Coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. The scale's ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance status rating (PSR), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity.

The framework addresses key challenges in large-scale genomic studies by defining expected outputs, quality metrics, and validation procedures that ensure harmonized variant calling across projects. This standardization is particularly important for collaborative efforts like the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), where multiple centers must produce comparable data that can be combined for downstream analysis.

FuGE facilitates the development of data standards in functional genomics in two ways. 1. FuGE provides a model of common components in functional genomics investigations, such as materials, data, protocols, equipment and software. These models can be extended to develop modular data formats with consistent structure. 2. FuGE provides a framework for capturing complete laboratory workflows, enabling the integration of pre-existing data formats. In this context, FuGE allows the capture of additional metadata that gives formats a context within the complete workflow. FuGE is available as a UML model and an XML Schema",

GA4GH schemas cover reference genomes and sequences, variant calls and annotations (compatible with VCF), sequencing reads and alignments (supporting BAM/CRAM), RNA quantification, continuous-valued genomic signals, genomic features and annotations, metadata about biosamples and individuals, phenotypic information using ontologies, and provenance tracking. The framework enables federated data access through APIs including hts-get for streaming genomic data, Beacon for discovery queries across datasets, Data Repository Service (DRS) for accessing data objects, Task Execution Service (TES) for running analysis workflows, and Workflow Execution Service (WES) for managing computational pipelines. GA4GH standards facilitate large-scale collaborative research initiatives, support FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), enable secure data sharing with privacy-preserving technologies, and provide the foundation for international genomics research networks, clinical genomics implementations, and precision medicine programs.",

The specification supports rectangular gates in n dimensions (i.e., from one-dimensional range gates up to n-dimensional hyper-rectangular regions), polygon gates in two (and more) dimensions, ellipsoid gates in n dimensions, decision tree structures, and Boolean collections of any of the types of gates. Gates can be uniquely identified and may be ordered into a hierarchical structure to describe a gating strategy. Gates may be applied on parameters as in list mode data files (e.g., FCS files) or on transformed parameters as described by any explicit parameter transformation. Therefore, since version 1.5, parameter transformation and compensation description are included as part of the Gating-ML specification.",

Extended versions (genePredExt) add fields for unique identifiers, CDS start/end status (complete/incomplete), exon frame information for each coding exon, and gene symbols or descriptions. The format efficiently represents complex transcript structures including alternative splicing isoforms, UTRs (untranslated regions), introns, and partial gene models. GenePred files support various gene prediction algorithms (GeneMark, Augustus, SNAP), RefSeq annotations, Ensembl gene builds, and GENCODE comprehensive gene sets. UCSC provides utilities including genePredToBed for BED format conversion, genePredToGtf for GTF conversion, and genePredToPsl for PSL format output. The format's compact structure and explicit exon coordinates make it ideal for genome browsers, annotation pipelines, and comparative genomics analyses requiring efficient storage and rapid retrieval of gene structure information across whole genomes.",

Combined representation of gene/gene product data and annotations leads to redundancy/repetition No way to represent gene/gene product metadata for unannotated genes Requirement to maintain backward compatibility makes it harder to introduce enhancements such as use of an ontology for evidence types GAF formats will continue to be supported, but the need for a way to represent genes/gene products separately from annotations, as well as the need to use the evidence ontology has lead to the creation of the GPAD (Gene Product Annotation Data) and GPI (Gene Product Information) formats, defined here.

GlycoCT incorporates a sophisticated block concept to efficiently handle frequently occurring structural features such as repeating units, which are common in biological carbohydrates. The format exists in two complementary variants: a condensed form optimized for database applications with strict sorting rules ensuring uniqueness for use as primary keys, and a more verbose XML syntax that provides enhanced readability and machine processing capabilities. Released under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, GlycoCT represents a significant advancement toward achieving a unified and broadly accepted sequence format in glycobioinformatics, encompassing the capabilities of the heterogeneous landscape of existing digital encoding schemata while providing the foundation for developing ontological relationships between glycan structural terms and supporting automated glycan structure analysis.\"",

Arden Syntax can be used to create a knowledge base for CDS systems that, when coupled with patient data, can generate patient-specific CDS interventions for improving patient care. The key change in Version 2.10 over Version 2.9 is inclusion of a normative XML representation for Arden Syntax. This was done because the use of XML facilitates the development of tools such as syntax checkers and editors that can help increase the correctness of executable knowledge modules, and this in turn will foster the augmentation of the development and production environments for Arden, thereby increasing its utility.",

The resource supports complex laboratory workflows by tracking specimen provenance through collection, transport, processing, and analysis stages, with fields for collection procedure, additive substances, container types, and special handling requirements. Specimen integrates with other FHIR resources including Patient, Practitioner, ServiceRequest, DiagnosticReport, and Observation to create complete clinical laboratory information workflows. The resource enables biobank specimen catalogs, clinical trial sample tracking, public health surveillance specimen management, and research biorepository operations. FHIR Specimen supports interoperability between laboratory information systems (LIS), electronic health records (EHR), biobank management systems, and research databases, facilitating standardized specimen data exchange across healthcare and research ecosystems while maintaining compliance with regulations for specimen handling, consent, and data privacy.",

Key PCD profiles include ACM (Alert Communication Management) for standardized alarm handling, DEC (Device Enterprise Communication) for device-to-enterprise integration, IDCO (Implantable Device Cardiac Observations) for cardiac device data, IPEC (Infusion Pump Event Communication) for infusion pump safety, PIV (Point of Care Infusion Verification) for medication verification, PCIM (Point of Care Identity Management) for device authentication, RDQ (Retrospective Data Query) for historical data retrieval, RTM (Rosetta Terminology Mapping) for standardized device terminology, and WCM (Waveform Communication Module) for physiological waveform data. These profiles leverage existing standards like HL7, DICOM, and IEEE 11073 to enable vendor-neutral device interoperability, supporting critical use cases such as automated vital signs documentation in electronic health records, integrated alarm management across monitoring systems, and safe medication administration workflows.",

The guidelines mandate the use of controlled vocabularies and standardized identifiers from MIRIAM Resources (identifiers.org) to annotate biological entities such as genes, proteins, metabolites, reactions, and pathways with unambiguous references to external databases like UniProt, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome. MIRIAM specifies the use of RDF (Resource Description Framework) and qualified annotations to encode biological semantics and relationships between model components and biological knowledge. The standard promotes model reusability by requiring clear licensing information (Creative Commons, etc.), encoded parameter units using standardized ontologies, and comprehensive documentation of model assumptions and limitations. MIRIAM compliance is supported by tools including the MIRIAM annotation editor in systems biology software, libSBML annotation functions, and BioModels Database validation workflows. The guidelines have been widely adopted by model repositories (BioModels, CellML Model Repository), enhancing model discoverability, integration into larger modeling frameworks, and facilitating quantitative comparison of alternative models representing the same biological system.",

The format supported both profile and centroid data representation modes and could accommodate various types of MS experiments including MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Despite its historical significance in establishing data standardization practices in proteomics, mzXML is now deprecated and has been superseded by the more comprehensive mzML format, which offers enhanced features, better compression, controlled vocabularies, and broader community support.

At times, this results in decisions that are not based in relational database modeling principles such as normalization. The model is designed to facilitate routine and rapid execution of distributed complex analytics. To meet this design requirement, some fields are duplicated across multiple tables to support faster analytic operations for distributed querying. The PCORnet CDM is based on the FDA Mini-Sentinel CDM. This allows PCORnet to more easily leverage the large array of analytic tools and expertise developed for the MSCDM v4.0, including data characterization approaches and the various tools for complex distributed analytics.",

By standardizing this data exchange, the standard reduces prescription abandonment, improves medication adherence, decreases prior authorization processing time, and enhances clinical decision-making by providing prescribers with transparent, actionable benefit information.

The format is built on HDF5, providing efficient storage and access to large-scale datasets while maintaining human-readable metadata. NWB's extensibility mechanism through neurodata extensions allows researchers to adapt the standard for novel recording modalities and experimental paradigms without breaking compatibility. The ecosystem includes PyNWB and MatNWB APIs for data creation and access, validation tools, and integration with the DANDI Archive for public data sharing. NWB adoption is growing across major neuroscience initiatives with support from Allen Institute, HHMI, Kavli Foundation, Simons Foundation, and INCF, facilitating reproducible research, cross-laboratory data integration, and development of standardized analysis pipelines across cellular, systems, and computational neuroscience.",

Each .nib file contains a single sequence record with a simple header specifying sequence length and format version, followed by the packed sequence data. The format stores sequences in a form optimized for rapid access by genome browsers and alignment algorithms, supporting efficient memory mapping for large-scale genomic analyses. While .nib files provide space-efficient storage, they lack the flexibility of indexed formats like 2bit (which can store multiple sequences) and have been largely superseded by more modern compressed formats. The format remains in use for legacy applications and continues to be supported by UCSC Genome Browser utilities including nibFrag for sequence extraction and faToNib/nibToFa for format conversion, primarily for maintaining compatibility with older genome browser implementations and analysis pipelines.",

It supports archetype specialization with explicit depth tracking, composition through archetype slots with assertion-based constraints, and domain-specific extensions via C_DOMAIN_TYPE classes. The AOM includes comprehensive primitive type constraints (C_DATE, C_TIME, C_STRING, C_INTEGER), reference mechanisms (ARCHETYPE_INTERNAL_REF, CONSTRAINT_REF), and assertion capabilities using first-order predicate logic. It provides the semantic foundation for archetype-enabled kernels, ADL parsers, and archetype validation systems in clinical information modeling, enabling programmatic manipulation of constraint structures and serving as the API specification for archetype-based software applications.",

The statement was revised following widespread consultation with learned societies, editors of journals and researchers. It consists of a 22 item checklist, and a summary table. The emphasis is on transparency to improve the quality of reporting and on the use of appropriate statistical techniques.The statement has been endorsed and welcomed by a number of professional special interest groups and societies including the Association of Medical Microbiologists (AMM), Bristish Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and the Infection Control Nurses' Association (ICNA) Research and Development Group. Like CONSORT, ORION considers itself a work in progress, which requires ongoing dialogue for successful promotion and dissemination. The statement is therefore offered for further public discussion and journals are encouraged to trial it as part of their reviewing and editing process and feedback to the authors.",

The standard defines a \"step\" as a single stride during human locomotion and specifies validation protocols using controlled laboratory testing on treadmills at various speeds (slow walking 2.0 mph, normal walking 3.0 mph, brisk walking 4.0 mph) as well as free-living wear tests in real-world conditions to evaluate device performance across diverse user populations and activity patterns. ANSI/CTA-2056 requires manufacturers to report step counting accuracy as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and specifies acceptable error thresholds - devices should achieve less than 10% error for controlled walking tests and less than 20% error for free-living conditions to meet the standard's performance benchmarks. The standard addresses measurement challenges including false positive step detection from upper body movements, vehicle vibrations, and daily living activities, as well as false negative errors from slow shuffling gaits or irregular walking patterns. ANSI/CTA-2056 promotes transparency by requiring clear disclosure of test conditions, participant demographics, reference measurement systems (ActiGraph accelerometers, manual observation), and statistical analysis methods used for validation. The standard facilitates comparability across commercial fitness trackers, smartwatches, and pedometer applications from manufacturers like Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, and Samsung, supporting consumer informed decision-making, clinical research applications requiring validated activity metrics, and workplace wellness programs utilizing step count goals for employee health initiatives.",

Quality control is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Several recent papers discuss relevant parameters for quality control and present applications to extract these from the instrumental raw data. What has been missing, however, is a standard data exchange format for reporting these performance metrics. We therefore developed the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example of the subsequent analysis possibilities.

Therefore all the information is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors, peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import and export of RDML data files.",

      "purpose_detail": "Despite years of research and hundreds of reports on tumor markers in oncology, the number of markers that have emerged as clinically useful is pitifully small. Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt to understand the reasons why multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses, patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis methods. In addition, the guidelines provide helpful suggestions on how to present data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and understand the context in which the conclusions apply.",

Each alignment line contains 11 mandatory fields including query name (QNAME), bitwise FLAG encoding mapping properties, reference sequence name (RNAME), 1-based leftmost mapping position (POS), mapping quality (MAPQ), CIGAR string describing alignment operations, mate pair information (RNEXT, PNEXT, TLEN), sequence (SEQ), and ASCII-encoded base quality scores (QUAL). The format supports optional fields as TAG:TYPE:VALUE triplets for storing additional information such as edit distance, alternative alignments, and aligner-specific metadata. SAM serves as the text-based companion to the binary BAM and compressed CRAM formats, with bidirectional conversion tools (samtools view) enabling interoperability. The format accommodates various alignment types including mapped, unmapped, secondary, supplementary, and chimeric alignments with proper-pair relationships.

This systematic encoding enables biobanks and biorepositories to consistently track and communicate how specimens were collected, processed, and preserved, which directly impacts molecular analyte stability and experimental reproducibility. By providing a standardized language for pre-analytical variation, SPREC facilitates data harmonization across biobanks, enables quality comparisons between specimen collections, supports regulatory compliance, and enhances the value of biological samples for translational research. The code is particularly valuable for multi-center studies where specimen provenance must be tracked and controlled. SPREC version 3.0 covers various specimen types including blood, tissue, urine, and other biological fluids, with specific codes for derivatives like DNA, RNA, and proteins.",

Incomplete and inadequate reporting of research hampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the medical literature.

Recommendations on the reporting of studies that are endorsed by leading medical journals can improve the quality of reporting.Observational research comprises several study designs and many topic areas. We aimed to establish a checklist of items that should be included in articles reporting such research - the STROBE Statement. We considered it reasonable to initially restrict the recommendations to the three main analytical designs that are used in observational research - cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.

The format includes sophisticated features for describing reaction kinetics, species concentrations, compartmentalization, parameter sensitivity, and dynamic behaviors through mathematical expressions and differential equations. SBML's modular design supports extensions for specialized modeling requirements including spatial modeling, flux balance analysis, and multi-scale simulations.

Despite the popularity of SBML, that has resulted in many models being available in electronic format, there is currently no standard way of communicating the results of the operations carried out with such models (e.g. simulations). Here we propose a new markup language which is complementary to SBML and which is intended to specify results from operations carried out on models SBRML. In fact, this markup language is useful also to communicate experimental data as long as it is possible to express the data in terms of a reference SBML model. Thus SBRML is a means of specifying quantitative results in the context of a systems biology model.",

The system covers diverse substance types including chemical compounds, proteins, nucleic acids, polymers, mixtures, structurally diverse materials, and specified substances (salts, stereoisomers, defined mixtures). UNIIs are generated at any time in the regulatory process and do not imply FDA review or approval. The GSRS database provides searchable access to UNIIs along with associated substance names, codes (CAS, INN, EC), structural representations, and attribute data. UNIIs are extensively used in SPL (Structured Product Labeling) documents, NDC (National Drug Code) directory, FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System), and international regulatory systems, facilitating interoperability between FDA databases and harmonization with global substance identification standards.",

LSDBs are curated by experts on their respective loci, and as such are typically the best resources of such information available. But LSDBs vary widely in format and completeness, making data integration and exchange among them difficult and time-consuming. To address these difficulties, the VarioML format has been developed for the full range of variation data use-cases, providing semantically well-defined components which can be easily composed to fit specific needs. Using VarioML, data owners can now efficiently enable the integration, federation, and exchange of their variant data. The discoverabiliaty, extensibility, and quality of variation data is immediately enhanced. Critical new avenues of research and knowledge discovery are opened, as data using the VarioML standard can be integrated with the global library of purely genetic data. VarioML is a central prerequisite for effective modelling of phenotype data and genotype-to-phenotype relationships. It removes the long-standing technical obstacles to the effective passing of variant data from discovery laboratories into the biomedical database world. Now all that is needed is the broad participation of the genotype-to-phenotype research community.",

The specification categorizes types of vocabulary modifications (additions, modifications, deprecations) and establishes governance mechanisms for implementing these changes through designated vocabulary maintenance groups. VMS defines roles and responsibilities for stakeholders including vocabulary maintainers, Interest Groups, and the broader TDWG community, specifying how change proposals are submitted, reviewed, and approved. The standard ensures that vocabulary evolution remains transparent, traceable, and backward-compatible where possible, while maintaining the stability needed for production systems. VMS applies to major TDWG vocabularies including Darwin Core terms and is essential for maintaining semantic interoperability across biodiversity data systems as scientific understanding and data practices evolve.",

As a W3C Recommendation and semantic extension of RDF, RDFS enables the description of groups of related resources and relationships between them by defining classes, properties, and their hierarchical structures. Unlike traditional object-oriented programming models that define classes in terms of their instance properties, RDFS takes a property-centric approach where properties are described in terms of the classes they apply to through domain and range mechanisms. This design philosophy promotes the extensibility principle of the Web, allowing anyone to define additional properties for existing resources without requiring modification of original class definitions. RDFS provides core vocabulary elements including rdfs:Class, rdfs:Resource, rdfs:Property, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:domain, rdfs:range, rdfs:label, and rdfs:comment, which form the basis for more sophisticated ontology languages like OWL. The schema supports the development of machine-readable vocabularies that can be processed automatically, enabling applications to discover and reason about resource relationships, making it an essential component of the Semantic Web infrastructure.",

Each entity supports comprehensive descriptive metadata including identifiers, names, descriptions, locations, dates, subjects, and crucially, relationships to other entities that create a connected graph of research infrastructure.

The ontology contains 443 classes organized in a hierarchical structure with a maximum depth of 5 levels, covering fundamental AI concepts from basic computational methods to complex neural architectures. AIO serves as a critical resource for AI researchers, practitioners, and systems developers who need standardized vocabularies for annotating AI models, describing experimental procedures, ensuring reproducibility, and enabling semantic interoperability between AI systems and databases. The ontology facilitates automated reasoning about AI systems, supports metadata annotation for AI workflows, and contributes to the broader goal of making artificial intelligence research more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.",

CVX codes are specifically designed for use in HL7 Version 2.3.1 and 2.5.1 immunization messages and electronic health record systems, facilitating standardized communication between healthcare providers, immunization information systems (IIS), and public health agencies. Each CVX code entry includes detailed information about vaccine status (active, inactive, pending, non-US, or never active), last update timestamp, and clinical notes providing context about usage and availability. When paired with MVX (manufacturer) codes, CVX codes can precisely identify specific trade-named vaccine products, supporting accurate inventory management, adverse event reporting, vaccine safety monitoring, and public health surveillance activities essential for maintaining population immunity and preventing vaccine-preventable diseases.",

The ontology integrates multiple disease classification systems including ICD, SNOMED CT, UMLS, and MeSH, providing extensive cross-references that enable interoperability between different medical coding systems. DOID structures diseases into logical hierarchies based on disease mechanisms, affected anatomical systems, and causal agents, enabling both broad categorical searches and precise disease identification. Each disease concept includes standardized names, definitions, synonyms, and relationships to parent and child terms, creating a rich semantic network that supports computational analysis of disease data. The ontology is extensively used in genomics databases, electronic health records, biomedical literature annotation, drug discovery pipelines, and epidemiological studies where consistent disease terminology is essential for data integration and comparative analysis.",

MHC restriction refers to the biological process by which T-cell recognition of antigens is limited to peptides presented by specific MHC molecules that are compatible with the T-cell's own MHC background. MRO systematically organizes the complex relationships between MHC alleles, T-cell responses, and antigen presentation contexts that are crucial for understanding adaptive immune responses, vaccine development, and transplantation immunology. The ontology enables precise annotation of immunological experiments by providing controlled vocabulary terms for MHC class I and class II molecules, their allelic variants, restriction patterns, and associated experimental conditions. This standardization is essential for comparative immunology studies, epitope mapping projects, and the development of personalized immunotherapies where accurate description of MHC-restricted immune responses is critical for data interpretation and clinical translation.",

The ontology encompasses multiple levels of protein organization including protein families and complexes, individual protein molecules, protein domains and regions, post-translational modifications, and protein isoforms generated through alternative splicing or processing. PR maintains extensive cross-references to major protein databases including UniProt, NCBI, and Ensembl, enabling seamless integration with existing protein annotation resources. The ontology supports advanced protein function annotation by providing precise vocabulary for describing enzymatic activities, binding sites, regulatory mechanisms, and cellular localization patterns. PR is essential for proteomics data standardization, comparative protein analysis, functional genomics research, and systems biology applications where consistent protein terminology facilitates data integration, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery across diverse experimental platforms.",

The platform excels in three primary use cases: exploratory data analysis (automatically detecting patterns in CSV, JSON, and database data), instant data publishing (using the `datasette publish` command to deploy data to cloud hosting providers like Google Cloud Run, Heroku, or Vercel), and rapid prototyping (spinning up JSON APIs in minutes for proof-of-concept development). Datasette is part of a broader ecosystem of 44 related tools and 154 plugins that enhance productivity when working with structured data. The tool supports multiple data import formats, provides built-in security features for data access control, and offers extensive customization options through its plugin architecture. Datasette serves data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local governments, scientists, researchers, and anyone seeking to make their data more accessible and discoverable through web-based interfaces.",

The method automatically determines the optimal number of neighbors (k) based on target transcript counts and identifies significant principal components using variance fold-thresholding against simulated noise datasets. ENHANCE processes UMI-count matrices in tab-separated format, supports gzip compression, and provides configurable parameters for neighbor selection, PC threshold determination, and precision control.

The framework provides an object-oriented architecture that enables the integration and standardization of multiple machine learning paradigms through reusable process models and templates. MLPro consists of several sub-frameworks organized as modules: MLPro-BF (Basic Functions) provides cross-sectional infrastructure including mathematics, data management, plotting capabilities, and logging; MLPro-SL supports supervised learning workflows; MLPro-RL implements reinforcement learning processes; MLPro-GT covers game theory applications; and MLPro-OA focuses on online adaptive machine learning. The architecture uses standardized interfaces that allow ML models to be embedded into training pipelines and operational workflows in a modular fashion. The framework integrates with external machine learning libraries including River (for online learning), scikit-learn (for supervised learning), and OpenML (for dataset and experiment management), providing wrappers that standardize their usage within MLPro processes. Development follows object-oriented design principles with test-driven development for quality assurance and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) practices. The framework includes an extension hub for third-party integrations, comprehensive documentation with API references, and an example pool demonstrating various use cases. MLPro supports hybrid ML applications that combine multiple learning paradigms and real-time adaptive systems. The project is developed and maintained by the Group for Automation Technology and Learning Systems at South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences in Germany. The source code is released under the Apache 2.0 license and is available through PyPI for installation.",

WES enables researchers to run standardized workflows, currently supporting Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Workflow Description Language (WDL) formats, on multiple platforms, clouds, and execution systems using a consistent interface. The API specification is written in OpenAPI and embodies RESTful service principles, using JSON for requests and responses with standard HTTP/HTTPS transport. Core functionality includes workflow submission with parameter passing, run status monitoring through detailed logs capturing stdout and stderr output, task-level execution tracking with timing and exit codes, and workflow cancellation capabilities. WES addresses critical use cases such as \"bring your code to the data\" scenarios where researchers submit custom analyses to run on externally-owned datasets without data transfer, and best-practices pipeline execution where researchers discover workflows from shared repositories like Dockstore and execute them over controlled data environments. The service implements OAuth2 bearer token authentication and authorization, with implementations responsible for verifying user credentials and enforcing submission policies. WES provides comprehensive service introspection through its service-info endpoint, reporting supported workflow types, versions, filesystem protocols, workflow engines, and system state information. The API supports paginated listing of workflow runs, detailed run logs with output file locations, and granular task-level monitoring. Run states include QUEUED, INITIALIZING, RUNNING, COMPLETE, EXECUTOR_ERROR, SYSTEM_ERROR, CANCELED, and PREEMPTED, enabling detailed tracking of workflow execution lifecycle. As a GA4GH standard, WES promotes interoperability across bioinformatics workflow execution platforms and supports integration with related GA4GH standards including the Data Object Service for credential management and the Task Execution Service for extended task definitions.",

Polars utilizes Apache Arrow columnar format for zero-copy data sharing and SIMD vectorization for cache-coherent algorithms. It supports both eager and lazy execution modes, with the lazy API enabling automatic query optimization and parallel execution across CPU cores. The library handles diverse data formats including CSV, JSON, Parquet, Delta Lake, AVRO, Excel, and direct database connections to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and cloud storage systems. Polars provides an intuitive expression API for data manipulation operations while maintaining minimal dependencies and fast import times (70ms vs 520ms for pandas), making it suitable for data analysis, ETL pipelines, and analytical workloads requiring high performance.",

These specifications combine to create specialized formats like Tabular Data Packages that integrate CSV/JSON data with JSON Schema-based metadata descriptors. The standards follow a \"small pieces, loosely joined\" philosophy, enabling individual components to be used independently or combined for complex data scenarios. They support cross-technology implementation with human-readable JSON metadata that facilitates machine processing, data validation, and automated discovery.

MI-CLAIM serves two primary purposes - enabling direct assessment of clinical impact including fairness considerations, and allowing rapid replication of the technical design process for clinical AI studies. The standard provides a comprehensive checklist in MS Word table format covering essential reporting elements including study design and data characteristics (patient demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data sources, temporal validation), model development details (feature engineering, architecture selection, hyperparameter tuning, training procedures), performance evaluation (metrics across demographic subgroups, confidence intervals, comparison to clinical standards), clinical implementation considerations (decision thresholds, interpretability mechanisms, failure modes), and ethical aspects (bias assessment, fairness metrics, regulatory status). The repository encourages community feedback through GitHub Issues to continuously improve the standard as the field evolves, promoting best practices for transparent, reproducible, and equitable clinical AI development and deployment across healthcare applications.",

This study proposes the Medical Imaging CDM (MI-CDM) extension, adding two new tables and two vocabularies to the OMOP CDM to address the structural and semantic requirements to support imaging research. The tables provide the capabilities of linking DICOM data sources as well as tracking the provenance of imaging features derived from those images. The implementation of the extension enables phenotype definitions using imaging features and expanding standardized computable imaging biomarkers. This proposal offers a comprehensive and unified approach for conducting imaging research and outcome studies utilizing imaging features.",
