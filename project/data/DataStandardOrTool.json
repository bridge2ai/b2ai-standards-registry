Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated. Version 1.2 is currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and BioCASE (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe) networks. Apart from the GBIF and BioCASE networks, the potential for the application of ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible).

In addition, BioPAX enables the development of pathway visualization from databases and facilitates analysis of experimentally generated data through combination with prior knowledge. The BioPAX effort is coordinated closely with that of other pathway related standards initiatives namely; PSI-MI, SBML, CellML, and SBGN in order to deliver a compatible standard in the areas where they overlap.",

Currently, the extent and type of information specific to the biospecimen preanalytical conditions reported in scientific publications and regulatory submissions varies widely. To improve the quality of research utilizing human tissues, it is critical that information regarding the handling of biospecimens be reported in a thorough, accurate, and standardized manner. The Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality (BRISQ) recommendations outlined herein are intended to apply to any study in which human biospecimens are used. The purpose of reporting these details is to supply others, from researchers to regulators, with more consistent and standardized information to better evaluate, interpret, compare, and reproduce the experimental results. The BRISQ guidelines are proposed as an important and timely resource tool to strengthen communication and publications around biospecimen-related research and help reassure patient contributors and the advocacy community that the contributions are valued and respected",

This document specifies the standard for providing Case Report Tabulations Data Definitions in an XML format for submission to regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA). The XML schema used to define the expected structure for these XML files is based on an extension to the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM). The 1999 FDA electronic submission (eSub) guidance and the electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) documents specify that a document describing the content and structure of the included data should be provided within a submission. This document is known as the Data Definition Document (e.g., define.pdf in the 1999 guidance). The Data Definition Document provides a list of the datasets included in the submission along with a detailed description of the contents of each dataset. To increase the level of automation and improve the efficiency of the Regulatory Review process, define.xml can be used to provide the Data Definition Document in a machine-readable format.",

It was the first language to be developed and plays the same role for chemistry as MathML for mathematics and GML for geographical systems. CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules, reactions, solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a special flexible approach to numeric science it also covers a very wide range of chemical properties, parameters and experimental observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been heavily informed by the current chemical scholarly literature and chemical databases. XML is a mainstream approach providing semantics for science, such as MathML, SBML/BIOPAX (biology), GML and KML (geo) SVG (graphics) and NLM-DTD, ODT and OOXML (documents). CML provides support for most chemistry, especially molecules, compounds, reactions, spectra, crystals and computational chemistry (compchem). CML has been developed by Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa since 1995. It is the de facto XML for chemistry, accepted by publishers and with more than 1 million lines of Open Source code supporting it. CML can be validated and built into authoring tools (for example the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Word). A list of CML-compliant and CML-aware software can be found on the software page. The infrastructure includes legacy converters, dictionaries and conventions, Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. There are several versions of the CML schema. The most recent schema is schema 3. This essentially relaxes many of the constraints imposed in the previous stable release (schema 2.4), allowing users to put together the elements and attributes in a more flexible manner to fit the data that they want to represent more easily.",

      "purpose_detail": "When taxonomic descriptions are prepared for input to computer programs, the form of the coding is usually dictated by the requirements of a particular program or set of programs. This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data. Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.",

An initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer was generated by open-ended interviews with patients experienced with the symptoms of cancer and oncology professionals. Using preselected criteria, items were reduced to a 38-item general version. Factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on 545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G). Coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. The scale's ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance status rating (PSR), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity.

As the size and complexity of data generated from such experiments grows, so does the requirement for standard data formats. To address these needs, the Functional Genomics Experiment [Object Model / Markup-Language] (FuGE-OM, FuGE-ML) has been created to facilitate the development of data standards.FuGE is a model of the shared components in different functional genomics domains. FuGE facilitates the development of data standards in functional genomics in two ways. 1. FuGE provides a model of common components in functional genomics investigations, such as materials, data, protocols, equipment and software. These models can be extended to develop modular data formats with consistent structure. 2. FuGE provides a framework for capturing complete laboratory workflows, enabling the integration of pre-existing data formats. In this context, FuGE allows the capture of additional metadata that gives formats a context within the complete workflow. FuGE is available as a UML model and an XML Schema",

The specification supports rectangular gates in n dimensions (i.e., from one-dimensional range gates up to n-dimensional hyper-rectangular regions), polygon gates in two (and more) dimensions, ellipsoid gates in n dimensions, decision tree structures, and Boolean collections of any of the types of gates. Gates can be uniquely identified and may be ordered into a hierarchical structure to describe a gating strategy. Gates may be applied on parameters as in list mode data files (e.g., FCS files) or on transformed parameters as described by any explicit parameter transformation. Therefore, since version 1.5, parameter transformation and compensation description are included as part of the Gating-ML specification.",

The key change in Version 2.10 over Version 2.9 is inclusion of a normative XML representation for Arden Syntax. This was done because the use of XML facilitates the development of tools such as syntax checkers and editors that can help increase the correctness of executable knowledge modules, and this in turn will foster the augmentation of the development and production environments for Arden, thereby increasing its utility.",

To meet this design requirement, some fields are duplicated across multiple tables to support faster analytic operations for distributed querying.

The statement was revised following widespread consultation with learned societies, editors of journals and researchers. It consists of a 22 item checklist, and a summary table. The emphasis is on transparency to improve the quality of reporting and on the use of appropriate statistical techniques.The statement has been endorsed and welcomed by a number of professional special interest groups and societies including the Association of Medical Microbiologists (AMM), Bristish Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and the Infection Control Nurses' Association (ICNA) Research and Development Group. Like CONSORT, ORION considers itself a work in progress, which requires ongoing dialogue for successful promotion and dissemination. The statement is therefore offered for further public discussion and journals are encouraged to trial it as part of their reviewing and editing process and feedback to the authors.",

Quality control is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Several recent papers discuss relevant parameters for quality control and present applications to extract these from the instrumental raw data. What has been missing, however, is a standard data exchange format for reporting these performance metrics. We therefore developed the qcML format, an XML-based standard that follows the design principles of the related mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML, and TraML standards from the HUPO-PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative). In addition to the XML format, we also provide tools for the calculation of a wide range of quality metrics as well as a database format and interconversion tools, so that existing LIMS systems can easily add relational storage of the quality control data to their existing schema. We here describe the qcML specification, along with possible use cases and an illustrative example of the subsequent analysis possibilities.

The RDML file format was created to encourage the exchange, publication, revision and re-analysis of raw qPCR data. The core of an RDML file is an experiment, not a PCR run. Therefore all the information is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors, peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import and export of RDML data files.",

      "purpose_detail": "Despite years of research and hundreds of reports on tumor markers in oncology, the number of markers that have emerged as clinically useful is pitifully small. Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt to understand the reasons why multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses, patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis methods. In addition, the guidelines provide helpful suggestions on how to present data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and understand the context in which the conclusions apply.",

The STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association studies (STREGA) initiative builds on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement and provides additions to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The additions concern population stratification, genotyping errors, modelling haplotype variation, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, replication, selection of participants, rationale for choice of genes and variants, treatment effects in studying quantitative traits, statistical methods, relatedness, reporting of descriptive and outcome data, and the volume of data issues that are important to consider in genetic association studies.

Incomplete and inadequate reporting of research hampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the medical literature. Readers need to know what was planned (and what was not), what was done, what was found, and what the results mean. Recommendations on the reporting of studies that are endorsed by leading medical journals can improve the quality of reporting.Observational research comprises several study designs and many topic areas. We aimed to establish a checklist of items that should be included in articles reporting such research - the STROBE Statement. We considered it reasonable to initially restrict the recommendations to the three main analytical designs that are used in observational research - cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We want to provide guidance on how to report observational research well. Our recommendations are not prescriptions for designing or conducting studies.

Despite the popularity of SBML, that has resulted in many models being available in electronic format, there is currently no standard way of communicating the results of the operations carried out with such models (e.g. simulations). Here we propose a new markup language which is complementary to SBML and which is intended to specify results from operations carried out on models SBRML. In fact, this markup language is useful also to communicate experimental data as long as it is possible to express the data in terms of a reference SBML model. Thus SBRML is a means of specifying quantitative results in the context of a systems biology model.",

LSDBs are curated by experts on their respective loci, and as such are typically the best resources of such information available. But LSDBs vary widely in format and completeness, making data integration and exchange among them difficult and time-consuming. To address these difficulties, the VarioML format has been developed for the full range of variation data use-cases, providing semantically well-defined components which can be easily composed to fit specific needs. Using VarioML, data owners can now efficiently enable the integration, federation, and exchange of their variant data. The discoverabiliaty, extensibility, and quality of variation data is immediately enhanced. Critical new avenues of research and knowledge discovery are opened, as data using the VarioML standard can be integrated with the global library of purely genetic data. VarioML is a central prerequisite for effective modelling of phenotype data and genotype-to-phenotype relationships. It removes the long-standing technical obstacles to the effective passing of variant data from discovery laboratories into the biomedical database world. Now all that is needed is the broad participation of the genotype-to-phenotype research community.",

The result is a unified hierarchical map of eukaryotic cell architecture. In the MuSIC hierarchy, nodes represent systems and arrows indicate containment of the lower system by the upper. Node color indicates known (gold) or putative novel (purple) systems. The size of each circle is based on the number of proteins in the system. The relative height of each system in the layout is determined based on the predicted diameter of the system in MuSIC.",

For example, you can use the GIS toolchain to define cohorts that include regional data on exposure to toxicants or social deprivation along with EHR data on relevant health outcomes. The toolchain also includes informatics resources that support integration with the main OHDSI tool stack (HADES) and integration with externally supported solutions for geocoding and for finding and deriving relevant data sources from catalogs of available data sources. Importantly, the toolchain allows integrated analysis of geospatial and EHR data without sharing any sensitive patient location data.",

The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) has been designed to accommodate a harmonized representation of observational healthcare data. This study proposes the Medical Imaging CDM (MI-CDM) extension, adding two new tables and two vocabularies to the OMOP CDM to address the structural and semantic requirements to support imaging research. The tables provide the capabilities of linking DICOM data sources as well as tracking the provenance of imaging features derived from those images. The implementation of the extension enables phenotype definitions using imaging features and expanding standardized computable imaging biomarkers. This proposal offers a comprehensive and unified approach for conducting imaging research and outcome studies utilizing imaging features.",
