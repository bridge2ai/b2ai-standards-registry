B2AI_USECASE:9	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Obtain social determinants of health data from patients.	Social determinants of health (SDoH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. These conditions are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. SDoH are largely responsible for health inequities - unfair and avoidable differences in health status from person to person. SDoH data may be collected directly from individuals or based on integration with other data, but it generally includes at least one of the following factors poverty and income inequality, education and literacy, employment and working conditions, gender and gender equality, social exclusion and discrimination, housing and living conditions, or access to healthcare.

B2AI_USECASE:10	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Obtain molecular proximity observations from microscopy images of human cells.	Images of objects at the microscale (i.e., those at 0.1–100μm) are obtained through a variety of microscopy approaches. In the CM4AI project, images of cell structures are obtained through confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.

B2AI_USECASE:13	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Integrate clinical record data with voice data.	Clinical records generally do not include mechanisms for accessing voice recordings. Data records must therefore be linked to associate voice data samples with their source patients.

B2AI_USECASE:14	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Transform data from OMOP to the i2b2 standard.	Transforming data from OMOP to the i2b2 standard involves converting the data from OMOP's schema to the i2b2 schema, which allows for the data to be more easily queried and analyzed using i2b2's tools and platforms. This involves mapping the data to equivalent concepts in the i2b2 schema, and may also involve cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure that it is in the correct format for use with i2b2.	Harry Caufield	caufieldjh	ORCID:0000-0001-5705-7831	[integration]	[chorus]	[B2AI_TOPIC:4]	[B2AI_STANDARD:775|B2AI_STANDARD:243]		True	True	False			
B2AI_USECASE:15	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Produce artifacts that map identifiers between source and standardized data representations.	The sets of identifiers shared between two or more data products serve as points of commonality between observations, but in practice, a desired level of interoperability may not be achievable without mapping some identifiers to equivalent terms. This may be necessary for entire namespaces (e.g., mapping all NCBI Gene identifiers to their corresponding UniProtKB protein accessions) or for a subset (e.g., mapping ChEBI entries for drugs to their identifiers in a drug-centric knowledge base). There may also be a need to define inexact matches: an identifier’s best mapping in another resource may be to a more broadly-defined concept.

B2AI_USECASE:16	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Link cellular objects to functions through associations between proteins, cell structure proximity, and transcriptomics.	As per Qin et al. (2021) Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04115-9), imaging data and biophysical association data may be combined to develop measurements of protein distance within subcellular systems. This use case builds on that strategy by adding a third component: measurement of transcript changes under perturbation conditions for each protein. For the CM4AI DGP, this process involves evidence graphs. The result here is not a full subcellular map, but rather the integrated data necessary to assemble such a map.

B2AI_USECASE:17	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Standardize clinical record data collected from multiple sites and sources.	Standardizing clinical record data across multiple sites and sources involves several steps, all with the goal of rendering it more usable in subsequent analyses. Data is first collected from electronic health records, clinical databases, surveys, and potentially other sources. Next, the data is cleaned and transformed to a consistent format. This may include removing duplicate records, filling in missing data, and standardizing field names and values. The data is then validated to ensure that it is accurate and complete. Standardized data is then integrated into a central repository.

B2AI_USECASE:18	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Standardize clinical waveform data collected from multiple sites and sources.	As with other clinical observations and records, standardizing waveform data is largely a process of collection, cleaning, transformation, validation, and storage. The features of waveforms, whether audio or cardiac in origin, require specific handling to ensure physiologically-relevant details are retained. Raw waveform data is quite large and therefore consumes more disk space than most database architectures are prepared to operate with. This data may be collected continuously, leading to accumulation of large quantities of incoming observations to store and analyze. standardization must therefore be sensitive to the size and resolution of waveform data.

B2AI_USECASE:19	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Standardize clinical image data collected from multiple sites and sources.	Standardizing clinical images across sites and sources involves ensuring that images are captured and stored in a consistent manner, so that they can be easily compared and analyzed. This may include following guidelines for image acquisition, e.g., recommended image resolution, contrast, and lighting conditions. It also includes image metadata properties such as consistent labeling and format. Depending on subsequent applications, it may require image processing, such as normalization, to correct for variations in appearance due to differences in equipment or patient positioning.

B2AI_USECASE:20	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Standardize clinical omics data collected from multiple sites and sources.	Standardizing clinical omics data involves methods for ensuring consistency and comparability across different sources. This can be achieved through common data formats, controlled vocabularies, and ontologies. It may also involve some degree of quality control, as data from multiple sources may not be subject to identical validation or filtering procedures.

B2AI_USECASE:21	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Assemble standards for integrated maps of human cell architecture.	As per Qin et al. (2021) Nature (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04115-9), imaging data and biophysical association data may be combined to develop measurements of protein distance within subcellular systems. When combined with other data (see B2AI_USECASE:16) the result is a map of cell architecture. Some degree of standardization will be necessary among these maps, such that they may be combined while retaining consistent biologically-relevant observations.

B2AI_USECASE:23	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Construct standards for computational provenance.	Computational provenance is a record of the processes and data used to produce a computational result. Constructing standards for computational provenance involves establishing protocols for how this information should be recorded, stored, and shared. This can include what information provenance records must contain, their format(s), and any connections to the resulting computation. Additionally, standards may be established for how provenance should be validated and authenticated to ensure its accuracy and trustworthiness.

B2AI_USECASE:25	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Develop models of clinical image data.	Developing models of clinical image data may involve annotation, preprocessing, and model training. Generally, annotation requires labeling  images with disease or clinical phenotype-relevant information such as labels, bounding boxes, and segmentation masks. The annotation process may be assisted by automated methods, particularly in cases where patient features are already known. Preprocessing such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation then prepares the labeled images for model training. The training process applies machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from the data and make predictions on new images.

B2AI_USECASE:26	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Develop pseudotime patient models of health and salutogenesis.	As presented by the AI-READI DGP, developing pseudotime patient models of health and salutogenesis hinges on the idea that health is a time-sensitive process, with various events contributing to a progression towards clinical outcomes in a chronological fashion. The exact amount of time between events may not be as important as their order and may therefore be abstracted.

As presented by the Voice DGP, a set of patient voice recordings may be analyzed in an automated manner through the machine learning approach of federated learning. In federated learning, a central model is first trained on a dataset distributed among many devices or clients. Individual clients train their own copies of the model on their own data, then send updated model parameters to the central server. The server then averages newly updated parameters from all clients to produce a new global model. It returns the new model to the clients and the process repeats.

B2AI_USECASE:30	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Test and deploy analytical models of clinical image data.	Given the availability of a model of clinical image data (as produced by B2AI_USECASE:25), testing and deploying the model generally involves creating a test data set, preprocessing the data by normalizing and converting it into a format that can be used by the model, evaluating the model's performance on the test set, then optimizing the model by re-training under different parameters or input data until the desired level of performance is achieved. There may be a need for converting the model to a format that can be used in a specific runtime environment or monitoring the model's performance in a production environment and making adjustments as needed. Deploying the analytical model may require consideration of validation, regulatory approval, ethics, and compliance with patient privacy laws.

B2AI_USECASE:33	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Build a relational database of arbitrary data types.	To set up a relational database, first choose a relational database management system (RDBMS). Create a schema to define the database structure, including the tables and fields. Build tables within the schema and define the fields and data types for each table, then populate them with data by inserting rows. It's also crucial to set up relationships between tables, such as linking a primary key in one table to a foreign key in another table. This ensures data integrity and simplifies querying.

B2AI_USECASE:37	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Train a linear regression model on data in an R tibble.	Training a linear regression model on data in the R tibble data structure generally involves R’s lm() function. To see the summary of the resulting model, use the summary() function on the model object. To make predictions using the model, use the predict() function on the model object and provide new data as the argument.

B2AI_USECASE:38	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Train a binary classification model on data in one or more Bioconductor objects.	Training a binary classification model on Bioconductor objects can be a convenient way to work with R statistical functions on large quantities of heterogeneous data. After any necessary preprocessing of the data, such as normalizing or filtering, split it into a training and test set. Then select a classification algorithm and use the training data to train a model. Test data may be used to evaluate the performance of the model and adjust any parameters as necessary.

B2AI_USECASE:39	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Train a neural network model on tensor data.	Training a neural network model on tensor data is a frequent use case for developing data analysis and prediction methods.

B2AI_USECASE:40	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Transform FHIR data to TSV.	Data described through the HL7 FHIR standard may take a variety of forms, owing to the standard’s intentional flexibility. A highly interpretable, easily parsed format such as TSV may be desirable as part of transformation or subsequent analysis.

B2AI_USECASE:41	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Determine whether enough data is available to train a computational model of interest.	Computational models may require a certain amount or complexity of data for their training to be effective. It may be useful to define these properties before beginning modeling.

B2AI_USECASE:42	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Assess the quality of a computational model in terms of its ability to complete a specific task.	Independent of their application, computational models may be evaluated using a core set of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

B2AI_USECASE:43	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Assess the potential bias in a computational model.	Even a high-performing computational model may be subject to bias, both explicitly and implicitly. The model may not accurately represent the population it was trained on. It may be algorithmically biased, with some features gaining weight over others in unexpected ways. There may be biases resulting from human preconceptions, e.g., human curators may have already made assumptions about disease status of patients contributing data to the model’s training set. There may also be unexpected confounders, such as social or economic factors contributing to clinical outcomes.

B2AI_USECASE:44	B2AI_USECASE:UseCase	Assess the explainability of a computational model.	Computational models are not equivalently explainable. A model’s operations may appear correct, but without the ability to justify its responses based on a particular reasoning process, it may remain challenging to identify its weaknesses.
