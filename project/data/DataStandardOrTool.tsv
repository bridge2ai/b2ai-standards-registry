The ABCD Schema attempts to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide variety of databases. It is compatible with several existing data standards. Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data and free-text can be accommodated. Version 1.2 is currently in use with the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and BioCASE (Biological Collection Access Service for Europe) networks. Apart from the GBIF and BioCASE networks, the potential for the application of ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access (e.g. datasets from external sources that shall not be converted and integrated into an institution's own data, but be kept separately, though easily accessible).

Each alignment block in an Axt file consists of four lines - a summary line containing alignment number, chromosome names, alignment start and end positions for both sequences, strand information, and alignment score, followed by the aligned sequence from the first genome, the aligned sequence from the second genome, and a blank separator line. The format uses zero-based coordinates for the first sequence and supports alignments on either strand, with sequences from the negative strand reverse-complemented. Axt files are particularly useful for representing whole-genome alignments between species (such as human-mouse or human-chimp comparisons) generated by alignment tools like BLASTZ or LASTZ. The format's straightforward structure makes it easy to parse programmatically and convert to other formats. UCSC provides utilities including axtToMaf for converting to MAF (Multiple Alignment Format), axtChain for chaining together alignments, and axtBest for selecting the best alignment for each position.

BigBed files store annotation items representing either simple genomic features or linked collections of exons, maintaining BED semantics while enabling efficient region-specific data transfer. Files are created using the bedToBigBed utility which converts sorted BED files into compressed binary format with built-in indexing, requiring chromosome sizes files and optionally AutoSql (.as) format definitions for describing standard and custom fields. The format supports BED3 through BED12 plus additional user-defined fields, with features including itemRgb color specification, extra searchable indices via the -extraIndex parameter for track hub item searches, and trackDb settings for mouseOver labels, field filtering, and URL transformations.

The formats are widely supported by genomics toolkits including samtools, htslib, htsjdk, and GATK, with standard operations for sorting, merging, filtering, and format conversion. CRAM offers significant storage savings particularly important for large-scale projects, while maintaining full compatibility with SAM/BAM workflows. Both formats support the htsget protocol for parallel streaming access and can be wrapped with crypt4gh encryption for secure data sharing.

CDASH provides a standardized framework for designing case report forms (CRFs) and electronic data capture (eCRF) systems by defining a common set of data collection fields and structures. The standard specifies field names, labels, prompt questions, and controlled terminology for capturing clinical observations, ensuring that data can be directly traced to the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) without extensive post-collection transformation. By harmonizing data collection at the source, CDASH reduces data cleaning efforts, improves data quality, and accelerates the transition from collection to analysis. The standard covers various therapeutic areas and data domains including demographics, vital signs, adverse events, concomitant medications, and laboratory results. CDISC provides a library of ready-to-use, CDASH-compliant annotated eCRFs in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, XML) that can be implemented as-is or customized for specific study needs, facilitating regulatory submission and data review processes.

Each chain alignment consists of a header line specifying score, chromosome identifiers, sizes, strands, and coordinates for both sequences, followed by alignment data lines describing ungapped blocks and the gaps between them. The format uses zero-based half-open intervals for coordinates and includes support for reverse-complement alignments through strand indicators. Chain files are particularly useful for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions, representing syntenic relationships, structural variations, and evolutionary rearrangements. They are commonly used in genome browsers and liftOver tools for mapping genomic coordinates between different genome assemblies or between species. The format supports \"snake\" or rearrangement display modes that visualize complex structural variants including inversions, duplications, and translocations.

It was the first language to be developed and plays the same role for chemistry as MathML for mathematics and GML for geographical systems. CML covers most mainstream chemistry and especially molecules, reactions, solid-state, computation and spectroscopy. Since it has a special flexible approach to numeric science it also covers a very wide range of chemical properties, parameters and experimental observation. It is particularly concerned with the communication between machines and humans, and machines to machines. It has been heavily informed by the current chemical scholarly literature and chemical databases. XML is a mainstream approach providing semantics for science, such as MathML, SBML/BIOPAX (biology), GML and KML (geo) SVG (graphics) and NLM-DTD, ODT and OOXML (documents). CML provides support for most chemistry, especially molecules, compounds, reactions, spectra, crystals and computational chemistry (compchem). CML has been developed by Peter Murray-Rust and Henry Rzepa since 1995. It is the de facto XML for chemistry, accepted by publishers and with more than 1 million lines of Open Source code supporting it. CML can be validated and built into authoring tools (for example the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Word). A list of CML-compliant and CML-aware software can be found on the software page. The infrastructure includes legacy converters, dictionaries and conventions, Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. There are several versions of the CML schema. The most recent schema is schema 3. This essentially relaxes many of the constraints imposed in the previous stable release (schema 2.4), allowing users to put together the elements and attributes in a more flexible manner to fit the data that they want to represent more easily.

C2M2 provides a standardized framework for describing biomedical research assets including files, biosamples, subjects, and collections with their associated metadata using controlled vocabularies and ontologies. The model consists of core entities (file, biosample, subject, project, collection) connected through relationships that capture data provenance, experimental context, and biological associations. C2M2 submissions include data tables describing these entities along with controlled vocabulary term usage tables that link to standard ontologies for enhanced semantic interoperability. The model supports supra-schematic constraints validated by dedicated tools, and includes ontology reference files for adding display names, descriptions, and synonyms to controlled terms. C2M2 enables the CFDE Workbench portal to provide unified search and browsing across heterogeneous Common Fund datasets, facilitating cross-program data discovery and promoting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for biomedical research data.

This restricts the type of data that can be represented, and the number of other programs that can use the data. Even when working with a particular program, it is frequently necessary to set up different versions of the same basic data, for example, when using restricted sets of taxa or characters to make special-purpose keys. The potential advantages of automation, especially in connexion with large groups, cannot be realized if the data have to be restructured by hand for every operation. The DELTA (DEscription Language for TAxonomy) system was developed to overcome these problems. It was designed primarily for easy use by people rather than for convenience in computer programming, and is versatile enough to replace the written description as the primary means of recording data. Consequently, it can be used as a shorthand method of recording data, even if computer processing of the data is not envisaged.	True	False	https://www.delta-intkey.com/

DICOM defines the formats and communication protocols for medical images (CT, MRI, ultrasound, X-ray, etc.) and associated metadata including patient demographics, study information, equipment parameters, and image acquisition details. The standard encompasses file formats, network protocols, and information models that enable interoperability across imaging devices, PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems), workstations, and clinical information systems. DICOM supports structured reporting through DICOM-SR for encoding measurements, annotations, and AI-generated findings in a standardized machine-readable format. The standard includes specialized modules for radiation dose tracking, workflow management, and integration of AI inference results. DICOM's comprehensive metadata structure and pixel data encoding make it essential for training and deploying AI models in medical imaging, while its widespread clinical adoption ensures that AI tools can integrate seamlessly into existing radiological workflows and health IT infrastructure.

EDF enables creation of common databases for sleep records, comparative analysis of algorithms across laboratories, and standardized evaluation of manual and automatic analysis methods. The format has been extended to EDF+, which maintains backward compatibility while adding support for interrupted recordings, annotations, stimuli, events, and analysis results such as deltaplots, QRS parameters, and sleep stages. EDF+ can store any medical recording including EMG, evoked potentials, and ECG data, with stricter specifications that enable automatic electrode localization and calibration. Both formats are freely available and widely adopted in commercial equipment and multicenter research projects.	True	False	https://www.edfplus.info/

FHIR defines a set of modular components called \"resources\" that represent discrete clinical and administrative concepts (patients, observations, medications, procedures, diagnostic reports, etc.) with well-defined data structures, terminology bindings, and RESTful API interactions. Each resource can be retrieved, created, updated, and searched via standard HTTP operations, enabling flexible system integration and mobile/web application development. FHIR supports multiple exchange paradigms including RESTful APIs, messaging, documents, and services, with extensibility mechanisms (profiles, extensions) to adapt to local requirements while maintaining interoperability. The standard leverages modern web technologies (JSON, XML), common terminologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm), and implementation guides to facilitate rapid deployment across EHR systems, clinical decision support tools, patient-facing applications, and research platforms. FHIR's structured, granular data representation and standardized APIs make it particularly suitable for AI/ML applications that require consistent access to longitudinal patient data, clinical observations, and healthcare workflows for training predictive models and deploying real-time decision support at the point of care.

Each sequence record consists of four lines containing a sequence identifier, the raw nucleotide sequence, a separator line, and ASCII-encoded quality scores (Phred scores) representing the confidence of each base call. The quality scores enable downstream tools to weight bases appropriately during alignment, variant calling, and assembly operations. FASTQ supports various quality encoding schemes (Phred+33, Phred+64) and accommodates reads of variable length from different sequencing technologies. The format's simultaneous representation of sequence and quality information is essential for quality control, error correction, read filtering, and AI/ML applications that require confidence metrics for training models on sequencing data quality assessment, base calling improvement, contamination detection, and metagenomic classification tasks.

Maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in collaboration with CMS, ICD-10-CM provides over 70,000 diagnosis codes with significantly expanded granularity compared to ICD-9-CM, enabling more precise documentation of disease severity, anatomical location, episode of care (initial encounter, subsequent encounter, sequela), and laterality (left, right, bilateral). The coding structure uses alphanumeric format with 3-7 characters where the first character is alphabetic, second is numeric, third through seventh provide increasing specificity of body site, etiology, severity, and clinical details, with optional seventh characters as extensions for encounter context or injury staging. Major chapters include infectious diseases (A00-B99), neoplasms (C00-D49), endocrine and metabolic disorders (E00-E89), mental and behavioral disorders (F01-F99), nervous system (G00-G99), circulatory (I00-I99), respiratory (J00-J99), digestive (K00-K95), musculoskeletal (M00-M99), and external causes of morbidity (V00-Y99). Critical features include combination codes that capture multiple conditions or manifestations in single codes, placeholder 'x' characters to allow for future expansion, and seventh character extensions for obstetric outcomes, fracture healing status, and diabetes complications. ICD-10-CM drives healthcare reimbursement through diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), enables clinical decision support systems through structured diagnosis data, supports population health analytics identifying disease trends and risk factors, powers epidemiological surveillance for CDC reportable conditions tracking disease outbreaks, and provides standardized terminology for electronic health record (EHR) systems ensuring interoperability.

Developed through extensive international collaboration involving thousands of health professionals across 90 countries, ICD-11 contains over 17,000 diagnostic categories with significantly enhanced granularity, clinical detail, and scientific accuracy compared to ICD-10, incorporating advances in medical knowledge including genomic medicine, patient safety, traditional medicine integration, and sexual health classifications. The classification uses a multi-hierarchical structure with foundation component enabling flexible content management, allowing multiple parent categories and post-coordination where complex conditions are composed by combining codes for anatomy, etiology, severity, temporality, and other clinical dimensions. Major structural improvements include entirely new chapters for traditional medicine (validated practices from Chinese, Ayurvedic, and other systems), extension codes for functional assessment using WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS), detailed antimicrobial resistance documentation, gaming disorder and other emerging conditions, and significantly expanded mental health classifications with dimensional assessments. ICD-11 features built-in multilingual support covering Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish with machine translation capabilities, linearizations tailored for different use cases (mortality reporting, morbidity statistics, primary care, clinical documentation), and modern URI-based coding enabling semantic web integration and FHIR compatibility. Critical technical features include embedded logical definitions using description logic enabling automated classification and consistency checking, standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) for EHR integration, and continuous online updating mechanism replacing decennial revision cycles with regular incremental updates. ICD-11 supports global health surveillance enabling real-time disease outbreak tracking, international health statistics comparability across countries and regions, research data standardization for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, health service planning through accurate disease burden measurement, and AI/machine learning applications through structured, semantically rich diagnostic data. Adoption varies globally with some countries implementing immediately while others transition gradually, essential for medical informaticians, public health authorities, clinical coders, WHO collaborating centers, and healthcare system planners.

B2AI_STANDARD:176	B2AI_STANDARD:OntologyOrVocabulary	ICD-9-CM	International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision Clinical Modification	Harry Caufield	caufieldjh	ORCID:0000-0001-5705-7831	[codesystem]	[B2AI_TOPIC:9]	ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification) was the official medical classification system used in the United States from 1979 until September 2015 for coding diagnoses and procedures in healthcare billing, epidemiological research, and health statistics, representing the U.S. clinical modification of WHO's ICD-9 with additional detail for morbidity classification. Developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and used by CMS for Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement, ICD-9-CM contained approximately 13,000 diagnosis codes and 3,000 procedure codes, structured with 3-5 digit numeric format where first three digits represent disease category and subsequent digits add specificity for anatomical location, etiology, or manifestations. Major diagnostic chapters included infectious and parasitic diseases (001-139), neoplasms (140-239), endocrine and metabolic diseases (240-279), mental disorders (290-319), nervous system (320-389), circulatory system (390-459), respiratory system (460-519), digestive system (520-579), genitourinary system (580-629), and external causes (E codes E800-E999) documenting injury circumstances. The procedure classification (Volume 3) used 2-4 digit numeric codes organized by anatomical system, covering surgical operations, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic interventions primarily for inpatient hospital settings. Despite decades of widespread adoption creating massive legacy datasets and establishing institutional coding workflows, ICD-9-CM became outdated due to limited specificity insufficient for modern medicine's diagnostic precision, exhausted code capacity with no room for new diseases or procedures, lack of laterality designation, and outdated medical terminology inconsistent with current clinical practice. The mandated transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS in October 2015 required extensive healthcare industry preparation including EHR system updates, coder retraining, and billing system modifications, yet ICD-9-CM remains critically important for historical medical records analysis, longitudinal epidemiological studies spanning pre-2015 data, retrospective cohort studies, trend analysis requiring crosswalk mappings between ICD-9 and ICD-10, and legacy system maintenance. Applications include historical disease surveillance tracking public health trends, health services research analyzing treatment patterns, medical informatics developing code translation algorithms, and archival medical data management, essential for health informaticians managing legacy data, epidemiologists conducting temporal studies, medical archivists, and researchers working with pre-2015 healthcare datasets.

MIRIAM defines requirements for model attribution including reference publications, creator information, creation dates, and modification history to ensure proper provenance tracking and reproducibility. The guidelines mandate the use of controlled vocabularies and standardized identifiers from MIRIAM Resources (identifiers.org) to annotate biological entities such as genes, proteins, metabolites, reactions, and pathways with unambiguous references to external databases like UniProt, ChEBI, Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome. MIRIAM specifies the use of RDF (Resource Description Framework) and qualified annotations to encode biological semantics and relationships between model components and biological knowledge. The standard promotes model reusability by requiring clear licensing information (Creative Commons, etc.), encoded parameter units using standardized ontologies, and comprehensive documentation of model assumptions and limitations. MIRIAM compliance is supported by tools including the MIRIAM annotation editor in systems biology software, libSBML annotation functions, and BioModels Database validation workflows. The guidelines have been widely adopted by model repositories (BioModels, CellML Model Repository), enhancing model discoverability, integration into larger modeling frameworks, and facilitating quantitative comparison of alternative models representing the same biological system.

It is intended to replace the previous two formats. This new format was originally given a working name of dataXML. The final name is mzML.

A large number of different software packages are available that produce output in a variety of different formats. It is intended that mzQuantML will provide a common format for the export of identification results from any software package. The format was originally developed under the name AnalysisXML as a format for several types of computational analyses performed over mass spectra in the proteomics context. It has been decided to split development into two formats, mzIdentML for peptide and protein identification and mzQuantML (described here), covering quantitative proteomic data derived from MS. The development of mzQuantML is driven by some general principles, specific use cases and the goal of supporting specific techniques, as listed below.

As one of the first standardized formats for MS data, mzXML provided a vendor-neutral way to represent complex mass spectrometry information including mass-to-charge ratios, intensity values, scan parameters, and instrument metadata in a structured, machine-readable format. The format supported both profile and centroid data representation modes and could accommodate various types of MS experiments including MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Despite its historical significance in establishing data standardization practices in proteomics, mzXML is now deprecated and has been superseded by the more comprehensive mzML format, which offers enhanced features, better compression, controlled vocabularies, and broader community support. While legacy systems may still encounter mzXML files, current best practices recommend migration to mzML for new data processing workflows and long-term data preservation in mass spectrometry applications.

The standard defines a \"step\" as a single stride during human locomotion and specifies validation protocols using controlled laboratory testing on treadmills at various speeds (slow walking 2.0 mph, normal walking 3.0 mph, brisk walking 4.0 mph) as well as free-living wear tests in real-world conditions to evaluate device performance across diverse user populations and activity patterns. ANSI/CTA-2056 requires manufacturers to report step counting accuracy as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and specifies acceptable error thresholds - devices should achieve less than 10% error for controlled walking tests and less than 20% error for free-living conditions to meet the standard's performance benchmarks. The standard addresses measurement challenges including false positive step detection from upper body movements, vehicle vibrations, and daily living activities, as well as false negative errors from slow shuffling gaits or irregular walking patterns. ANSI/CTA-2056 promotes transparency by requiring clear disclosure of test conditions, participant demographics, reference measurement systems (ActiGraph accelerometers, manual observation), and statistical analysis methods used for validation. The standard facilitates comparability across commercial fitness trackers, smartwatches, and pedometer applications from manufacturers like Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, and Samsung, supporting consumer informed decision-making, clinical research applications requiring validated activity metrics, and workplace wellness programs utilizing step count goals for employee health initiatives.

PEP uses a YAML-based configuration file (project_config.yaml) that points to a sample annotation table (typically CSV or TSV) containing sample attributes, along with optional subsample tables for complex hierarchical relationships. The specification defines a formal structure for representing sample metadata with arbitrary attributes, derived attributes computed from other columns, sample modifiers for conditional processing, and implied attributes inferred from organizational context. PEP supports amendments for alternative project configurations, subanotations for linking multiple data files to single samples, and project-level metadata including descriptions, keywords, and namespace information. The format is designed to make projects portable across compute environments, reproducible through version-controlled configurations, and interoperable across analysis tools through a growing ecosystem of PEP-compatible software (looper, pypiper, pepr, geofetch, pephub). PEP's structured metadata representation enables systematic queries across sample collections, facilitates batch processing and parallelization of analyses, supports complex experimental designs with multiple data types per sample, and provides a foundation for FAIR data practices in genomics and multi-omics research. The specification is particularly valuable for managing large-scale projects with hundreds or thousands of samples, enabling metadata-driven workflow execution, automated data retrieval, and standardized documentation that supports reproducible computational research and machine learning applications requiring well-annotated training datasets.

The RDML file format was created to encourage the exchange, publication, revision and re-analysis of raw qPCR data. The core of an RDML file is an experiment, not a PCR run. Therefore all the information is collected which is required to understand an experiment. The structure of the file format was inspired by a database structure. In the file are several master elements, which are then referred to in other parts of the file. This structure allows to reduce the amount of redundant information and encourages the user to provide useful information. The Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) is a structured and universal data standard for exchanging quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. The data standard should contain sufficient information to understand the experimental setup, re-analyse the data and interpret the results. The data standard is a compressed text file in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and enables transparent exchange of annotated qPCR data between instrument software and third-party data analysis packages, between colleagues and collaborators, and between authors, peer reviewers, journals and readers. To support the public acceptance of this standard, both an on-line RDML file generator is available for end users, as well as RDML software libraries to be used by software developers, enabling import and export of RDML data files.

Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt to understand the reasons why multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumor marker studies have not been reported in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalizability of study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumor marker studies was a major recommendation of the National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. As for the successful CONSORT initiative for randomized trials and for the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses, patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis methods. In addition, the guidelines provide helpful suggestions on how to present data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and understand the context in which the conclusions apply.

Assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of this evidence, and hence the ability to synthesize it, has been limited by inadequate reporting of results. The STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association studies (STREGA) initiative builds on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement and provides additions to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The additions concern population stratification, genotyping errors, modelling haplotype variation, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, replication, selection of participants, rationale for choice of genes and variants, treatment effects in studying quantitative traits, statistical methods, relatedness, reporting of descriptive and outcome data, and the volume of data issues that are important to consider in genetic association studies.

The STROBE Statement is being endorsed by a growing number of biomedical journals. Incomplete and inadequate reporting of research hampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the studies reported in the medical literature. Readers need to know what was planned (and what was not), what was done, what was found, and what the results mean. Recommendations on the reporting of studies that are endorsed by leading medical journals can improve the quality of reporting.Observational research comprises several study designs and many topic areas. We aimed to establish a checklist of items that should be included in articles reporting such research - the STROBE Statement. We considered it reasonable to initially restrict the recommendations to the three main analytical designs that are used in observational research - cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.

SBML is a common format that many systems biology software understand and thus it has become the way in which models are shared and communicated. Despite the popularity of SBML, that has resulted in many models being available in electronic format, there is currently no standard way of communicating the results of the operations carried out with such models (e.g. simulations). Here we propose a new markup language which is complementary to SBML and which is intended to specify results from operations carried out on models SBRML. In fact, this markup language is useful also to communicate experimental data as long as it is possible to express the data in terms of a reference SBML model.

LSDBs are curated by experts on their respective loci, and as such are typically the best resources of such information available. But LSDBs vary widely in format and completeness, making data integration and exchange among them difficult and time-consuming. To address these difficulties, the VarioML format has been developed for the full range of variation data use-cases, providing semantically well-defined components which can be easily composed to fit specific needs. Using VarioML, data owners can now efficiently enable the integration, federation, and exchange of their variant data. The discoverabiliaty, extensibility, and quality of variation data is immediately enhanced. Critical new avenues of research and knowledge discovery are opened, as data using the VarioML standard can be integrated with the global library of purely genetic data. VarioML is a central prerequisite for effective modelling of phenotype data and genotype-to-phenotype relationships. It removes the long-standing technical obstacles to the effective passing of variant data from discovery laboratories into the biomedical database world. Now all that is needed is the broad participation of the genotype-to-phenotype research community.	True	False	https://github.com/VarioML/VarioML	https://github.com/VarioML/VarioML																
B2AI_STANDARD:303	B2AI_STANDARD:BiomedicalStandard	VMS	Vocabulary Maintenance Standard	Harry Caufield	caufieldjh	ORCID:0000-0001-5705-7831		[B2AI_TOPIC:5]	The Vocabulary Maintenance Standard (VMS) is a TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards) specification that defines formal procedures for maintaining and evolving controlled vocabularies used in biodiversity informatics. Unlike traditional standards that remain relatively static, VMS recognizes that vocabulary standards must adapt incrementally to meet evolving community needs without requiring the full standards ratification process for every change. The specification categorizes types of vocabulary modifications (additions, modifications, deprecations) and establishes governance mechanisms for implementing these changes through designated vocabulary maintenance groups. VMS defines roles and responsibilities for stakeholders including vocabulary maintainers, Interest Groups, and the broader TDWG community, specifying how change proposals are submitted, reviewed, and approved. The standard ensures that vocabulary evolution remains transparent, traceable, and backward-compatible where possible, while maintaining the stability needed for production systems. VMS applies to major TDWG vocabularies including Darwin Core terms and is essential for maintaining semantic interoperability across biodiversity data systems as scientific understanding and data practices evolve.

The format consists of a file header, DIB header (with multiple versions: BITMAPCOREHEADER, BITMAPINFOHEADER, BITMAPV4HEADER, BITMAPV5HEADER), optional color palette, and pixel array storing uncompressed or RLE-compressed bitmap data. BMP supports 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits per pixel, accommodating indexed color (palettes), RGB color, and alpha channels for transparency. The format uses little-endian byte ordering and stores pixel rows bottom-to-top by default, with each row padded to 4-byte boundaries. BMP files can contain color profiles (ICC) for color management and support various compression methods including BI_RGB (uncompressed), BI_RLE4/BI_RLE8 (run-length encoding), and BI_BITFIELDS (custom RGB bit masks). The simplicity, widespread familiarity, and open format specification make BMP common in Windows applications, image processing software, and scientific imaging. While BMP files are typically large due to minimal compression, they compress efficiently with lossless algorithms (ZIP, RAR). BMP is used in GDI (Graphics Device Interface) subsystems, icons (ICO), cursors (CUR), and as an intermediate format for image processing. Software support is extensive: Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Microsoft Office, browsers (Chrome, Edge), and programming libraries across platforms. In AI/ML imaging applications, BMP serves as a raw, lossless format for medical imaging (preserving pixel accuracy), training data preparation (avoiding compression artifacts), image annotation workflows, and intermediate processing steps where format simplicity facilitates pixel-level manipulation for computer vision tasks, though typically converted to compressed formats for efficient storage and transmission.

GIF became widely adopted on the early web for its efficient compression and cross-platform compatibility, and remains ubiquitous for short animated loops and simple graphics with well-defined edges. The format supports two versions (GIF87a and GIF89a), with the latter adding animation delays, transparent backgrounds, and application-specific metadata. While the LZW patent controversy drove development of PNG as an alternative, GIF's animation capabilities and \"hot\" data accessibility (frames stored sequentially without random access penalties) maintain its relevance for social media reactions, educational demonstrations, and web UI elements. Modern applications leverage GIF's deterministic looping (via Netscape Application Block extension) and universal browser support, though video formats like WebP and MP4 increasingly replace GIF for better compression ratios. The format's 256-color limitation makes it suitable for logos, diagrams, and pixel art but less appropriate for photographs or gradients, where dithering techniques are often applied. GIF files consist of a logical screen descriptor, optional global color table, image descriptors with optional local color tables, and LZW-encoded pixel data stored in sub-blocks.

As an IETF standard (draft specifications progressing toward RFC status), JSON Schema defines a JSON-based format for specifying the expected shape of JSON data, including data types, required properties, value ranges, string patterns, array constraints, and object structures. The schema itself is expressed in JSON, enabling meta-schema validation and recursive definitions. JSON Schema supports multiple vocabularies including Core, Validation, Hyper-Schema for hypermedia, and Format for semantic validation. Widely adopted across industries with 60+ million weekly downloads, it powers API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger), configuration validation, code generation, form generation in UIs, and data interchange contracts. Major implementations exist in JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, and 40+ other languages, with extensive tooling ecosystem including validators, generators, linters, and editors. JSON Schema enables confident JSON data handling through streamlined testing, seamless data exchange via shared understanding, and clear documentation for developer collaboration.

KGX provides both a formal specification and a Python toolkit (kgx library) for transforming, validating, and exchanging knowledge graphs conforming to the Biolink Model. The format represents graphs as nodes (entities with identifiers, categories, and properties) and edges (relationships with predicates, subject/object references, and provenance), serialized in JSON, TSV, or RDF formats. KGX ensures semantic alignment by enforcing Biolink Model categories (e.g., Gene, Disease, Pathway) and predicates (e.g., causes, treats, interacts_with), enabling consistent cross-database integration. The toolkit supports graph transformations (merging, filtering, mapping), format conversions (Neo4j, RDF, GraphML), and validation against Biolink Model constraints. KGX is foundational for Translator knowledge graphs, integrating data from 150+ biomedical sources including Monarch Initiative, NCATS Biomedical Data Translator, and Clinical Data Commons. In AI/ML applications, KGX-formatted knowledge graphs power link prediction for drug repurposing, knowledge graph embeddings for biomedical entity representation learning, reasoning algorithms for hypothesis generation, and multi-modal knowledge integration combining genomics, phenotypes, pathways, and clinical data to support precision medicine and systems biology research.

PostScript uses reverse Polish notation and an interpreted execution model where documents are programs that, when executed by a PostScript interpreter (Raster Image Processor or RIP), render pages at the target device's resolution. The language describes graphics using vector primitives (straight lines, cubic Bézier curves) enabling arbitrary scaling, rotation, and transformation without quality loss, crucial for professional typography and technical illustrations. PostScript's sophisticated font system uses outline fonts with font hinting to maintain glyph quality at low resolutions, standardized through Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 font formats that influenced modern font technologies like TrueType and OpenType. Three major versions exist: PostScript Level 1 (1984) introducing basic page description capabilities, PostScript Level 2 (1991) adding improved speed, image decompression (JPEG support), composite fonts, color separation, and form caching, and PostScript 3 (1997) providing enhanced color handling with up to 4096 gray levels, smooth shading operations, DeviceN color space for spot colors, and better filtering. PostScript powered the Apple LaserWriter (1985), triggering the desktop publishing revolution by enabling WYSIWYG document creation on Macintosh with PageMaker software. The language became the de facto standard for electronic prepress systems, high-end typesetters (Linotronic), and professional printing workflows throughout the 1980s-1990s. PostScript's imaging model directly influenced PDF (Portable Document Format), Adobe's 1993 successor that simplified PostScript for document distribution by removing general-purpose programming features while retaining the imaging model, making PDF documents static data structures rather than executable programs. PostScript remains common in high-end printers, professional publishing, and scientific visualization where precise vector graphics control is required. Open-source implementations like Ghostscript enable PostScript rendering on devices lacking native PostScript support. Scientific applications include generation of publication-quality figures from computational analysis software, precise technical diagrams, and device-independent archival documents.

As a W3C Recommendation and semantic extension of RDF, RDFS enables the description of groups of related resources and relationships between them by defining classes, properties, and their hierarchical structures. Unlike traditional object-oriented programming models that define classes in terms of their instance properties, RDFS takes a property-centric approach where properties are described in terms of the classes they apply to through domain and range mechanisms. This design philosophy promotes the extensibility principle of the Web, allowing anyone to define additional properties for existing resources without requiring modification of original class definitions. RDFS provides core vocabulary elements including rdfs:Class, rdfs:Resource, rdfs:Property, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:domain, rdfs:range, rdfs:label, and rdfs:comment, which form the basis for more sophisticated ontology languages like OWL. The schema supports the development of machine-readable vocabularies that can be processed automatically, enabling applications to discover and reason about resource relationships, making it an essential component of the Semantic Web infrastructure.

RIF-CS serves as the foundational data interchange format for Research Data Australia and enables institutions to contribute metadata about their research assets to national and international discovery services. The schema organizes metadata into four core entity types with rich relationship modeling capabilities - collections (datasets, databases, repositories), services (software tools, web services, facilities), parties (researchers, institutions, funders), and activities (projects, programs, events). Each entity supports comprehensive descriptive metadata including identifiers, names, descriptions, locations, dates, subjects, and crucially, relationships to other entities that create a connected graph of research infrastructure.

RDF provides a graph-based data model where resources are identified by IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) and relationships form a directed, labeled graph. The framework enables decentralized knowledge representation, allowing anyone to make statements about any resource and merge distributed data seamlessly. RDF Schema (RDFS) extends RDF with vocabulary for describing classes, properties, domain, range, and hierarchical relationships, enabling semantic reasoning and inference. RDF supports multiple serialization formats including Turtle (human-readable), RDF/XML (verbose XML), JSON-LD (JSON-based), and N-Triples (line-oriented). The semantic web stack builds upon RDF: OWL for rich ontologies, SPARQL for querying RDF graphs, SHACL for shape validation. RDF powers linked open data initiatives (DBpedia, Wikidata), biomedical ontologies (OBO Foundry, Bio2RDF), knowledge graphs (Google Knowledge Graph principles), and enterprise knowledge management. The framework enables data integration across heterogeneous sources by providing common vocabularies (Dublin Core, FOAF, Schema.org) and federated querying. In AI/ML contexts, RDF graphs serve as structured knowledge bases for knowledge graph embeddings (TransE, DistMult, ComplEx), semantic reasoning for inference rules, ontology-guided feature engineering, and multi-relational learning where symbolic knowledge augments statistical learning, enabling explainable AI and knowledge-driven machine learning systems.

The format supports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 24-bit color depths with optional alpha channel for transparency, allowing representation of grayscale, RGB, and RGBA images with various bit depths per channel. SGI images can be stored uncompressed or with run-length encoding (RLE) compression for reduced file sizes while maintaining lossless quality. The format was widely used in professional computer graphics, visual effects, scientific visualization, and medical imaging during the 1980s-1990s when SGI workstations dominated high-end graphics computing. SGI files use .sgi, .rgb, .rgba, .bw, or .int file extensions depending on color configuration and bit depth. The format specifies image dimensions, number of channels (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA), compression method, and pixel data in a header-based structure readable by graphics software on big-endian systems. While largely superseded by more modern formats like PNG and TIFF for general use, SGI format remains relevant in legacy scientific visualization applications, particularly in medical imaging archives, computational fluid dynamics visualization, and legacy 3D rendering pipelines. ImageMagick, GIMP, and specialized scientific visualization software maintain SGI format support for backward compatibility with historical image datasets. The format's simplicity and direct pixel representation made it suitable for high-performance graphics rendering on SGI's proprietary hardware and OpenGL-based visualization systems.

Launched in 2018, TF Hub pioneered the concept of \"transfer learning building blocks\" by packaging not just model weights but complete computational graphs including preprocessing layers, embedding extractors, and prediction heads that can be composed into larger architectures. Hub modules span text embeddings (Universal Sentence Encoder, BERT, LaBSE), image feature vectors (MobileNet, EfficientNet, ResNet), object detection (SSD, Faster R-CNN), image generation (BigGAN, StyleGAN), video understanding (I3D, MoViNet), and audio processing (YAMNet, TRILL). Each module provides a consistent interface via hub.KerasLayer or hub.load(), supporting both feature extraction (trainable=False) and fine-tuning (trainable=True) modes with automatic gradient flow through module internals. TF Hub emphasizes model cards with detailed documentation on training data, performance metrics, intended use cases, and ethical considerations (bias, fairness), promoting responsible AI deployment. The platform supports multiple serving formats including TensorFlow Lite for mobile/edge deployment, TensorFlow.js for in-browser inference, and TensorFlow Serving for production APIs, with modules optimized for quantization and pruning. Hub's standardized interface enables model composition where text embeddings feed into classification heads, or image encoders combine with text encoders for multimodal learning. For researchers, TF Hub reduces training time and computational costs by providing pre-trained representations on large-scale datasets (Wikipedia, ImageNet, YouTube-8M) that transfer effectively to specialized domains with limited data.

As a genuine upper ontology, BFO provides foundational categories that are domain-neutral and applicable across all areas of scientific investigation, rather than containing domain-specific terms. BFO distinguishes between continuants (entities that endure through time, such as objects, qualities, and spatial regions) and occurrents (entities that unfold over time, such as processes and temporal regions), providing a rigorous framework for representing the fundamental structure of reality. The ontology employs formal logic (first-order logic, OWL2) to define its 39 core classes and relations, ensuring precise semantics and enabling automated reasoning. BFO is used by over 550 ontology-driven projects worldwide as the top-level framework for domain ontologies in biomedicine (OBO Foundry ontologies like GO, CHEBI, Uberon), healthcare (OGMS for disease), environmental science, manufacturing, and military intelligence. The ontology promotes interoperability by providing consistent upper-level structure, enabling ontology integration and cross-domain data federation. BFO has been developed through extensive international collaboration, with contributions from philosophers, logicians, and domain scientists, and is continuously refined based on practical applications. In AI/ML contexts, BFO provides foundational structure for knowledge graphs, enabling ontology-guided reasoning, semantic data integration across heterogeneous sources, knowledge representation for explainable AI, and principled ontology alignment, supporting knowledge-driven machine learning where symbolic foundations enhance statistical learning with formal semantics.

The core model is a graph decomposing genotypes into smaller components of variation, from complete genotypes specifying sequence variation across entire genomes down to specific allelic variants and sequence alterations. This partonomy structure enables integrated analysis of G2P data where phenotype annotations are made at different granularity levels. GENO describes genotype attributes including zygosity, genomic position, expression, dominance, and functional dependencies or consequences of variants. Beyond heritable genomic sequence variation, GENO represents transient variation in gene expression from knockdown reagents or overexpression constructs, representing this variation in terms of targeted genes to parallel sequence variation representation. GENO models G2P associations focusing on genotype-phenotype-environment interplay and uses the Scientific Evidence and Provenance Information Ontology (SEPIO) for provenance and experimental evidence. The ontology is orthogonal to but integrates with the Sequence Ontology (SO), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Feature Annotation Location Description Ontology (FALDO), and Variation Ontology (VariO), supporting AI/ML applications in variant effect prediction, phenotype association analysis, and precision medicine.

HsapDv encompasses both embryonic and postnatal stages, utilizing Carnegie staging system for prenatal development (Carnegie stages 1-23 covering days 1-56 post-fertilization, approximately embryonic weeks 1-8) which provides morphology-based developmental milestones independent of gestational age variations. Embryonic stages capture critical developmental events including fertilization, cleavage, blastocyst formation, gastrulation, neurulation, organogenesis, and fetal development through birth. Postnatal stages include neonatal period (birth to 28 days), infancy (1 month to 2 years), early childhood (2-6 years), middle childhood (6-12 years), adolescence (12-18 years encompassing puberty), young adulthood (18-40 years), middle adulthood (40-65 years), and late adulthood/senescence (65+ years) with subdivisions for geriatric populations. Each stage is formally defined with temporal boundaries, morphological characteristics, physiological milestones (motor skills, cognitive development, hormonal changes), and relationships to other developmental stages through \"immediately_preceded_by\" and \"part_of\" relations. HsapDv integrates with Uberon for anatomical structure development timing, enabling queries like \"when does the cerebral cortex develop\" or \"which genes are expressed in neural tube during neurulation.\" Applications span developmental biology research (temporal annotation of gene expression atlases, single-cell RNA-seq developmental trajectories, epigenetic modification timelines), clinical medicine (prenatal diagnosis, developmental delay assessment, age-appropriate clinical reference ranges), teratology studies (critical periods for teratogen exposure), pharmacology (age-specific drug metabolism and dosing), and epidemiology (age-stratified disease incidence). HsapDv enables cross-species developmental comparisons through alignment with other species-specific developmental ontologies (mouse MmusDv, zebrafish ZFS), facilitating translational research and comparative embryology. The ontology is distributed in OBO and OWL formats through http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hsapdv.owl and browsable via OBO Foundry portals, supporting reproducible temporal annotation in biomedical databases, developmental atlases, and clinical decision support systems.

B2AI_STANDARD:483	B2AI_STANDARD:OntologyOrVocabulary	OLATDV	Medaka Developmental Stages	Harry Caufield	caufieldjh	ORCID:0000-0001-5705-7831	[obofoundry]	[B2AI_TOPIC:5]	The Medaka Developmental Stages ontology (OlatDv) provides standardized terminology for describing developmental stages of medaka (Oryzias latipes, Japanese rice fish), a key teleost model organism in developmental biology, genetics, toxicology, and comparative vertebrate research, based on Iwamatsu staging system and developed from the original Medaka Fish Ontology (MFO) by Thorsten Henrich. Medaka serves as a powerful model organism complementing zebrafish and mouse due to its transparent embryos enabling live imaging, short generation time (2-3 months), small size suitable for laboratory culture, fully sequenced genome with conserved vertebrate gene organization, and established genetic tools including transgenesis, CRISPR/Cas9 editing, and mutant libraries. OlatDv encompasses embryonic and larval stages from fertilization through sexual maturity, currently focusing on pre-adult development. Embryonic stages follow Iwamatsu's morphological staging system (stages 1-40) covering fertilization (stage 1), cleavage (stages 2-7), blastula (stages 8-10), gastrulation (stages 11-17), neurulation (stages 18-20), organogenesis (stages 21-30), and pre-hatching development (stages 31-40 leading to hatching at approximately day 7-10 post-fertilization at 26°C). Each stage is defined by specific morphological landmarks including somite numbers, heart development, pigmentation patterns, fin bud appearance, eye development, and gill filament formation. Post-hatching larval stages capture metamorphosis, scale formation, sex differentiation, and juvenile maturation through first reproduction. OlatDv provides temporal annotations crucial for comparative developmental biology studies examining vertebrate evolution, particularly teleost-specific genome duplication events and developmental innovations. Applications include temporal annotation of gene expression databases (Medaka Expression Database), developmental toxicology studies (OECD fish embryo toxicity tests using medaka as alternative to zebrafish), endocrine disruption research (sex determination mechanisms), carcinogenesis studies (medaka exhibits spontaneous tumor formation), and aging research (short lifespan enables longitudinal studies). Integration with Uberon anatomical ontology enables queries linking developmental stage to organ system maturation, essential for understanding tissue-specific gene expression changes during development. OlatDv facilitates cross-species developmental comparisons through alignment with zebrafish ZFS, frog XAO, and mammalian developmental ontologies, supporting evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) research and identification of conserved versus lineage-specific developmental programs across vertebrates. The ontology is distributed through OBO Foundry as olatdv.obo and olatdv.owl formats.

Developed by Janna Hastings and collaborators, MF extends the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) upper-level framework and integrates with domain ontologies including the Mental Disease Ontology (MD) for psychiatric disorders, the Cognitive Atlas for cognitive processes, the Emotion Ontology for affective states, and the Gene Ontology (GO) for molecular underpinnings of neural function. The ontology comprehensively represents cognitive domains including perception (visual, auditory, somatosensory, chemosensory), attention (selective, divided, sustained), memory (working, episodic, semantic, procedural), executive functions (planning, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, decision-making), language processing, and reasoning, alongside emotional and motivational constructs such as valence, arousal, mood states, personality traits, and social cognition (theory of mind, empathy, social perception). MF captures temporal dynamics of mental processes (onset, duration, termination), intensity dimensions, and contextual dependencies, enabling nuanced representation of psychological phenomena. Integration with clinical terminologies like DSM-5, ICD-11, and RDoC (Research Domain Criteria) facilitates translational psychiatry linking basic neuroscience to clinical phenotypes. Applications include standardized annotation of neuroimaging studies identifying brain regions associated with specific mental functions, computational psychiatry modeling mental disorders as disruptions in cognitive and emotional processes, natural language processing extracting mental state descriptions from clinical notes, AI-based mental health assessment systems, meta-analysis of psychological experiments through unified terminology, and personalized medicine approaches tailoring psychiatric treatments to individual cognitive profiles. MF follows OBO Foundry principles with open-source development, logical consistency checking, and community-driven refinement, essential for computational neuroscience, digital mental health platforms, cognitive science research, and integrative brain databases.

MHC restriction refers to the biological process by which T-cell recognition of antigens is limited to peptides presented by specific MHC molecules that are compatible with the T-cell's own MHC background. MRO systematically organizes the complex relationships between MHC alleles, T-cell responses, and antigen presentation contexts that are crucial for understanding adaptive immune responses, vaccine development, and transplantation immunology. The ontology enables precise annotation of immunological experiments by providing controlled vocabulary terms for MHC class I and class II molecules, their allelic variants, restriction patterns, and associated experimental conditions. This standardization is essential for comparative immunology studies, epitope mapping projects, and the development of personalized immunotherapies where accurate description of MHC-restricted immune responses is critical for data interpretation and clinical translation.

MOP encompasses reaction mechanisms (nucleophilic substitution, electrophilic addition, radical reactions, pericyclic reactions), molecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π-π stacking, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions), conformational changes (protein folding, ligand-induced conformational shifts, allosteric transitions), energy transfer processes (fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET, photoinduced electron transfer, vibrational energy relaxation), and transport phenomena (diffusion, membrane permeation, active transport, facilitated diffusion). The ontology provides detailed mechanistic descriptions including activation energies, transition states, reaction intermediates, rate-determining steps, and catalytic cycles essential for understanding chemical reactivity and biological function at the molecular scale. MOP integrates with the Chemical Methods Ontology (CHMO) for experimental techniques, CHEBI for chemical entities, and the Gene Ontology (GO) for biological processes, enabling comprehensive annotation of molecular transformations from pure chemistry through biochemistry to systems biology. Applications include annotation of reaction databases for synthetic chemistry planning, mechanistic modeling of enzymatic catalysis, drug-target interaction mechanisms for rational drug design, metabolic pathway analysis with detailed reaction mechanisms, and computational chemistry workflow documentation. MOP supports reproducibility in mechanistic studies by standardizing descriptions of reaction conditions, stereochemical outcomes, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity patterns. The ontology enables semantic searches for reactions by mechanism type, facilitating discovery of analogous transformations across different chemical contexts and supporting retrosynthetic analysis in computer-aided synthesis planning tools.

OAE structures adverse events hierarchically under upper-level classes from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), integrating with domain ontologies including OGMS (disease processes), VO (vaccine components), DRON (drug products), and UBERON (anatomical structures) to capture mechanistic relationships between interventions, biological processes, and observed adverse outcomes. The ontology distinguishes between adverse events (any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with intervention use) and adverse drug reactions (events with causal relationship to intervention), incorporating causality assessment frameworks (Naranjo scale, WHO-UMC criteria) as logical axioms that infer ADR status based on evidence patterns. OAE represents clinical manifestations (symptoms, signs, laboratory abnormalities), severity grades (CTCAE scales from mild to life-threatening), temporal patterns (immediate hypersensitivity, delayed reactions, cumulative toxicity), and anatomical localizations, supporting detailed phenotyping of safety profiles. The ontology enables cross-study aggregation of adverse event data by providing standardized terms that harmonize heterogeneous reporting formats from FDA FAERS, EMA EudraVigilance, WHO VigiBase, and clinical trial databases, facilitating meta-analyses of intervention safety and identification of rare adverse events invisible in individual studies. OAE supports pharmacovigilance signal detection by structuring adverse event hierarchies that enable mining of parent-child term relationships, discovering drug-event associations through disproportionality analysis (ROR, IC025), and prioritizing signals for regulatory review. In vaccine safety surveillance, OAE terms annotate Brighton Collaboration case definitions for standardized adverse event reporting post-vaccination (AEFI), supporting global safety monitoring networks coordinated by WHO. For AI/ML applications, OAE provides structured labels for training natural language processing models to extract adverse event mentions from clinical notes, social media posts, and regulatory documents, enables knowledge graph construction linking drugs, vaccines, adverse events, and patient characteristics for predictive safety modeling, and supports explainable AI systems that generate human-interpretable safety signals by reasoning over ontology-encoded mechanistic pathways connecting interventions to adverse outcomes, ultimately enhancing patient safety through earlier detection and characterization of intervention-related harms.

RS catalogs 5,000+ rat strains spanning inbred strains with defined genetic backgrounds (Wistar, Sprague-Dawley, Fischer 344, Brown Norway), outbred stocks with genetic heterogeneity, recombinant inbred lines for QTL mapping, consomic strains where complete chromosomes are substituted between strains, and gene-edited models (CRISPR knockouts, transgenic insertions) targeting specific disease mechanisms. The ontology structures strain relationships through \"derived from\" properties linking parent-progeny strains, \"has genetic background\" properties specifying founding strains for congenic lines, and \"model of\" properties connecting strains to disease phenotypes (hypertension, diabetes, cancer susceptibility), enabling navigation of complex breeding schemes and genetic derivations. RS terms include strain-specific metadata on phenotypic characteristics (coat color, obesity, behavioral traits), genetic markers (microsatellites, SNPs), tissue/cell sources, husbandry requirements, and availability from repositories (Rat Resource and Research Center, Charles River), facilitating experimental planning and reproducibility. The ontology integrates with RGD's comprehensive annotations linking strains to quantitative trait loci (QTL), genes, pathways, diseases, and phenotypes (Mammalian Phenotype Ontology terms), supporting genome-wide association studies (GWAS), eQTL mapping, and systems genetics analyses that connect genetic variation to physiological endpoints. RS enables translational research by mapping rat models to human disease orthologs, facilitating target validation for drug discovery where rat pharmacology and toxicology data inform human clinical trial design, particularly for cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders where rat models recapitulate human pathophysiology better than mouse models. In AI/ML applications for precision medicine, RS provides structured metadata for training genomic prediction models that associate strain genotypes with phenotypic outcomes, supports knowledge graph construction linking rat genetic data to human disease mechanisms for cross-species inference, and enables meta-analyses aggregating phenotypic data across studies by standardizing strain identifiers, ultimately accelerating translational discoveries by leveraging the rat's role as a premier mammalian model for human disease research.

Developed by the H3ABioNet consortium and aligned with OBO Foundry principles, SCDO encompasses genetic variants (HbS, HbC, HbE, beta-thalassemia mutations), disease phenotypes (sickle cell anemia HbSS, HbSC disease, HbS-beta thalassemia, sickle cell trait), clinical manifestations (vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke, priapism, splenic sequestration, chronic organ damage), laboratory findings (hemoglobin electrophoresis patterns, reticulocyte counts, bilirubin levels, fetal hemoglobin percentages), complications (pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, avascular necrosis, leg ulcers, retinopathy), treatment modalities (hydroxyurea, blood transfusions, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, pain management), and patient outcomes (quality of life measures, hospitalization rates, mortality). The ontology integrates genetic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment concepts to support comprehensive SCD patient data management and research. SCDO enables standardized phenotyping for genotype-phenotype correlation studies identifying disease modifiers (fetal hemoglobin levels, alpha-thalassemia co-inheritance, genetic polymorphisms affecting disease severity), facilitates clinical trial recruitment through precise inclusion/exclusion criteria specification, and supports electronic health record integration for automated SCD surveillance and quality improvement initiatives. Applications include natural history studies characterizing disease progression patterns, pharmacogenomics research examining hydroxyurea response variability, health disparities research documenting access to disease-modifying therapies, and global SCD registries enabling cross-population comparisons. SCDO facilitates data harmonization across international SCD cohorts, enabling meta-analyses and collaborative research essential for rare disease studies where no single center has sufficient patient numbers.

STATO encompasses five major categories: statistical tests (parametric tests including t-tests, ANOVA, ANCOVA, linear regression, mixed models; non-parametric tests including Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Spearman correlation; and specialized methods like survival analysis, multivariate analysis, time series analysis), probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson, exponential, chi-square, t-distribution, F-distribution) essential for understanding test assumptions, descriptive statistics (measures of central tendency including mean, median, mode; measures of dispersion including standard deviation, variance, interquartile range; and measures of shape including skewness, kurtosis), data types and variables (categorical/nominal, ordinal, continuous, discrete, dependent/independent variables, covariates, confounding variables), and experimental design concepts (randomization, blocking, replication, control groups, factorial designs, crossover designs, longitudinal studies). STATO provides formal OWL definitions enabling automated reasoning about test conditions of application, linking test selection to data characteristics (e.g., use Mann-Whitney U when comparing two independent groups with non-normal distributions), and capturing assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity, independence) that must be verified before test application. Each statistical method includes textual definitions for human understanding, formal logical definitions for machine reasoning, associated R code snippets via 'R-command' annotations enabling direct implementation, and documentation of appropriate use cases and interpretation guidelines. STATO integrates with BFO (Basic Formal Ontology) as upper-level ontology and OBI (Ontology for Biomedical Investigations) for process definitions, ensuring interoperability across biomedical ontologies. Applications include annotation of analysis methods in ISA-Tab metadata files for omics studies, standardized reporting of statistical procedures in publications to meet journal guidelines (CONSORT, STROBE, ARRIVE), automated validation of statistical analysis workflows in computational notebooks, education and training through formal definitions of statistical concepts with R implementation examples, and text mining of scientific literature to extract statistical method usage patterns. STATO supports reproducibility by precisely specifying analysis procedures, capturing multiple testing correction methods (Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, permutation tests), effect size measures (Cohen's d, odds ratios, hazard ratios), and confidence interval calculations. The ontology facilitates peer review by enabling reviewers to verify appropriate test selection and assists researchers in choosing correct statistical methods based on study design and data characteristics.

Developed in the 1960s-1970s by the College of American Pathologists, SNMI represented one of the earliest attempts to create a comprehensive, multi-axial medical nomenclature covering topography (anatomy), morphology (structural changes), etiology (causes), and function (physiological processes). SNMI employed a systematic coding structure where concepts were represented by alphanumeric codes and could be combined using post-coordination to express complex clinical findings (e.g., combining topography codes with morphology codes to describe disease locations and characteristics). The terminology was designed primarily for pathology and clinical documentation, providing structured vocabulary for diagnoses, procedures, and laboratory findings. SNMI evolved through several versions including SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine), SNOMED II, and SNOMED III before being integrated into SNOMED CT (Clinical Terms) in 2002 through merger with UK's Clinical Terms Version 3 (Read Codes). While SNMI itself is now deprecated and replaced by SNOMED CT for current clinical use, it is historically significant as a foundational medical terminology that pioneered multi-axial compositional approaches to medical concept representation. Legacy SNMI data may still exist in historical medical records and research databases, requiring mapping to modern terminologies for interoperability. Understanding SNMI's structure provides context for SNOMED CT's architecture and the evolution of standardized medical terminologies used in electronic health records, clinical research, and healthcare data analytics.

VBO structures breed information using OBO Foundry principles, capturing breed names, synonyms (alternate spellings, historical names, local language variants), geographical origins, breed characteristics (size, coat color, production traits), and relationships to parent breeds or breed groups. The ontology integrates with DAD-IS's 15,000+ national breed populations representing 8,800+ breeds maintained by 182 countries' National Coordinators, ensuring global coverage and continuous updates reflecting new breed registrations and naming conventions. VBO supports cross-species breed queries by organizing breeds under species-specific classes (bovine breeds, equine breeds) while maintaining inter-breed relationships such as \"derived from\" for composite breeds and \"related to\" for breeds sharing genetic heritage. The ontology enables precise phenotype-genotype associations in animal genetics research by providing stable breed identifiers (VBO IDs) that link to genomic datasets, genetic variant databases, and phenotype repositories, facilitating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in livestock. VBO integrates with other biomedical ontologies including the Livestock Breed Ontology (LBO), Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP), and UBERON anatomy ontology to support complex queries across breed characteristics, anatomical features, and disease susceptibilities. For agricultural genomics, VBO enables tracking of breed-specific genetic diversity, conservation status of rare breeds (endangered, critical, vulnerable), and lineage documentation for breeding programs aimed at preserving genetic resources. In AI/ML applications, VBO provides structured metadata for training computer vision models on breed classification, natural language processing systems for extracting breed information from veterinary records, and knowledge graphs connecting breed genetics to production traits (milk yield, growth rate, disease resistance) and animal welfare indicators, supporting precision livestock farming and genomic selection programs.

VT encompasses broad trait categories including morphological traits (body size, organ dimensions, skeletal measurements, integument characteristics), physiological traits (metabolic parameters, cardiovascular function, respiratory capacity, immune response, reproductive performance), behavioral traits (temperament, learning ability, social interactions, feeding behavior), production traits critical for livestock industries (growth rate, feed efficiency, milk yield, egg production, meat quality, wool production), disease resistance traits (pathogen susceptibility, vaccine response, parasite load), and life history traits (longevity, fertility, developmental timing). Each trait is formally defined with measurement methodologies, units, biological context, and relationships to anatomical structures (via Uberon) and biological processes (via Gene Ontology). VT serves as the primary phenotype ontology for agricultural animal genomics databases including AnimalQTLdb (quantitative trait loci database for cattle, pig, chicken, sheep, horse, rainbow trout), supporting annotation of QTL mapping studies that identify genomic regions influencing economically important traits. The ontology enables cross-species phenotype comparisons essential for translational research, allowing researchers to leverage livestock as biomedical models (e.g., pig cardiovascular traits for human heart disease research, sheep bone traits for osteoporosis studies). Applications span livestock breeding programs through genomic selection where VT standardizes trait definitions for estimated breeding values (EBVs), wildlife conservation genetics for monitoring population health indicators, aquaculture for trait improvement in fish and shellfish, and comparative physiology studies examining adaptive evolution of traits across vertebrate lineages. VT facilitates GWAS (genome-wide association studies) meta-analyses by harmonizing trait definitions across studies, enables phenotype-driven queries in genomics databases (\"find all QTL affecting milk fat percentage in dairy cattle\"), and supports machine learning models predicting complex traits from genotype data by providing structured phenotype representations. Integration with other ontologies including Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and Clinical Measurement Ontology (CMO) enables bidirectional translation between agricultural animal research and human biomedicine.

Launched in 2006, AWS pioneered the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model, transforming IT economics by offering pay-as-you-go pricing, elastic scalability, and eliminating upfront capital expenditures for hardware, enabling organizations from startups to enterprises to access enterprise-grade infrastructure previously available only to large corporations. AWS's compute offerings range from general-purpose EC2 instances for traditional workloads to specialized instance types optimized for memory-intensive applications (R-series), compute-intensive HPC (C-series, Hpc7a), GPU-accelerated deep learning (P5, G5, Trn1 with AWS Trainium/Inferentia chips), and serverless Lambda functions billed per millisecond execution time. The platform's storage hierarchy includes S3 for durable object storage with 99.999999999% durability, S3 Glacier for archival with retrieval SLAs from minutes to hours, EBS for low-latency block storage attached to EC2 instances, and EFS for scalable shared file systems supporting concurrent access across thousands of compute nodes. AWS's managed database services eliminate operational overhead of patching, backups, and replication, offering relational databases (Amazon RDS for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server; Amazon Aurora with MySQL/PostgreSQL compatibility), NoSQL databases (DynamoDB for key-value, DocumentDB for MongoDB workloads), graph databases (Neptune), time-series databases (Timestream), and data warehouses (Redshift) with columnar storage for OLAP queries on petabyte-scale datasets. For AI/ML workloads, AWS SageMaker provides end-to-end ML lifecycle management with built-in algorithms, Jupyter notebooks, distributed training across GPU clusters, hyperparameter tuning, model deployment to real-time/batch inference endpoints, and MLOps capabilities (model registry, monitoring, CI/CD pipelines). AWS Bedrock offers access to foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon Titan via unified API with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities connecting models to enterprise data in S3 or knowledge bases. The platform's security model includes IAM for fine-grained access control with role-based policies, KMS for encryption key management, CloudHSM for FIPS 140-2 Level 3 hardware security modules, AWS Shield for DDoS protection, GuardDuty for threat detection, and comprehensive compliance certifications (SOC 1/2/3, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP, ISO 27001) enabling deployment of regulated workloads. AWS supports hybrid cloud architectures through AWS Outposts (on-premises hardware running AWS services), AWS Direct Connect (dedicated network connections bypassing public internet), and Storage Gateway (seamless cloud-extension of on-premises storage), enabling gradual cloud migrations and latency-sensitive edge computing scenarios. For AI/ML infrastructure in Bridge2AI and biomedical research, AWS provides scalable compute for genome sequencing analysis (AWS Batch, EC2 Spot instances), secure storage for HIPAA-compliant patient data (S3 with server-side encryption, VPC endpoints preventing internet exposure), managed databases for clinical trial data (RDS with automated backups, multi-AZ high availability), federated learning frameworks (AWS HealthLake for FHIR-based interoperability), and specialized AI services for medical imaging analysis (AWS HealthImaging, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels), accelerating research workflows while maintaining data privacy, auditability, and compliance with healthcare regulations.

The algorithm uses k-nearest neighbor aggregation to identify similar cells, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) to remove noise components while retaining significant biological variation. The method automatically determines the optimal number of neighbors (k) based on target transcript counts and identifies significant principal components using variance fold-thresholding against simulated noise datasets. ENHANCE processes UMI-count matrices in tab-separated format, supports gzip compression, and provides configurable parameters for neighbor selection, PC threshold determination, and precision control. The tool enhances downstream analyses such as clustering, trajectory inference, and differential expression by reducing technical artifacts while maintaining cell type distinctions and biological relationships in single-cell transcriptomic data.

Founded in 2017 by Carbonite co-founders, Wasabi operates 16 globally distributed storage regions across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, with SOC-2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS certified data centers providing enterprise-grade security, immutability features (WORM, Object Lock), and compliance certifications (HIPAA, GDPR, FERPA) suitable for regulated industries. Wasabi's \"always hot\" architecture eliminates tiered storage complexity by storing all data on high-performance disk arrays with consistent millisecond latency for reads/writes, avoiding cold storage retrieval delays that plague glacier-tier alternatives while maintaining cost parity with archival storage services. The platform's S3 API compatibility ensures drop-in replacement for existing AWS workflows, supporting standard S3 operations (PUT, GET, LIST, multipart uploads), bucket policies, IAM-style access controls, and seamless integration with S3-compatible tools (AWS CLI, SDKs, third-party backup software, media asset managers). Wasabi's zero-fee model for egress, API requests, and reads eliminates the unpredictable costs that typically double hyperscaler storage bills, enabling cost-effective access for AI/ML training pipelines, video surveillance archives, genomic datasets, and medical imaging repositories where frequent data retrieval is essential. The service provides native integrations with major backup platforms (Veeam, Commvault, Rubrik), media workflows (Adobe Premiere, Frame.io), surveillance systems (Milestone, Hanwha), and object storage gateways, supporting hybrid cloud architectures where on-premises applications seamlessly tier to Wasabi for capacity expansion and disaster recovery. For AI/ML workloads, Wasabi's high-throughput object storage (up to 10 Gbps per connection) supports rapid dataset ingestion for model training, low-latency access to training data during distributed training across GPU clusters, and cost-effective storage for model checkpoints, experiment artifacts, and inference result archives without egress penalties for iterative model development and hyperparameter tuning requiring repeated dataset access.

WES enables researchers to run standardized workflows, currently supporting Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Workflow Description Language (WDL) formats, on multiple platforms, clouds, and execution systems using a consistent interface. The API specification is written in OpenAPI and embodies RESTful service principles, using JSON for requests and responses with standard HTTP/HTTPS transport. Core functionality includes workflow submission with parameter passing, run status monitoring through detailed logs capturing stdout and stderr output, task-level execution tracking with timing and exit codes, and workflow cancellation capabilities. WES addresses critical use cases such as \"bring your code to the data\" scenarios where researchers submit custom analyses to run on externally-owned datasets without data transfer, and best-practices pipeline execution where researchers discover workflows from shared repositories like Dockstore and execute them over controlled data environments. The service implements OAuth2 bearer token authentication and authorization, with implementations responsible for verifying user credentials and enforcing submission policies. WES provides comprehensive service introspection through its service-info endpoint, reporting supported workflow types, versions, filesystem protocols, workflow engines, and system state information. The API supports paginated listing of workflow runs, detailed run logs with output file locations, and granular task-level monitoring. Run states include QUEUED, INITIALIZING, RUNNING, COMPLETE, EXECUTOR_ERROR, SYSTEM_ERROR, CANCELED, and PREEMPTED, enabling detailed tracking of workflow execution lifecycle. As a GA4GH standard, WES promotes interoperability across bioinformatics workflow execution platforms and supports integration with related GA4GH standards including the Data Object Service for credential management and the Task Execution Service for extended task definitions.

It provides a common vocabulary that webmasters can use to mark up their pages in ways that can be understood by major search engines and other applications. The Schema.org vocabulary consists of a set of types (e.g., Person, Event, Organization), properties (e.g., name, location, startDate), and relationships that can be used with many different encoding formats including RDFa, Microdata, and JSON-LD. As of 2024, over 45 million web domains use Schema.org markup with over 450 billion Schema.org objects. The vocabulary is continuously evolving through an open community process managed by the W3C Schema.org Community Group.
