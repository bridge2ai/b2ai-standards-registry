# GitHub Actions Scripts

This directory contains scripts designed specifically for use with GitHub Actions workflows. These scripts are intended to be run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline and should not be run manually.

## Overview

The scripts in this directory automate various tasks related to testing, deployment, and maintenance within GitHub Actions. Each script is triggered by a corresponding YAML workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.

## Script List

- **Trigger Conditions**: This workflow runs when thereâ€™s a new issue created with the
